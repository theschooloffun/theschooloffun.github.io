        <p>It was raining outside then. A very heavy rain… and there was no way we could go out to the playground. Even stepping out of the door could get us wet!</p>

<p>To me, I was grateful we were indoor. Safe and dry. To the little guy, it was such a torture when he couldn’t get out of the house! Well, I understand that feeling… If I have as much energy as he has, I would probably throw a fit, too.</p>

<p>Out were all our kits… just to ensure that nobody got frustrated (the little guy, for not being able to go out… me, for having to deal with his tantrum).  Since it was all wet outside, I couldn’t help but to think about making a fish… :)</p>

<p><strong>What we had</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>egg cartons</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>markers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>paint</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>paint brush</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cotton buds</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Let the Fun Begin!</strong></p>

<p>First, we cut out one and a half egg carton. The half part was for the tail.</p>

</div>

<p>I thought it would be a great time to introduce him to cotton bud painting. Just for a change from the usual paint brush.</p>

<p><strong>Red Flag:</strong></p>

<p>When I introduced him to cotton bud painting, I was perfectly sure that he wouldn’t stick the cotton buds up his nose or ears!</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2010/08/27_fish_02.jpg" title="Cotton bud, his new magic wand" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2010/08/27_fish_02.jpg" alt="Cotton bud, his new magic wand" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Cotton bud, his new magic wand</p>
    
</div>

<p>Too bad, after a while, he didn’t seem to be interested in the cotton buds anymore. He took the paint brush and showed his loyalty to the ol’ paint brush.</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2010/08/27_fish_03.jpg" title="Back to the brush" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2010/08/27_fish_03.jpg" alt="Back to the brush" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Back to the brush</p>
    
</div>

<p>While he was busy painting, I took one cotton bud and swapped it on a paper. I think it looked pretty artistic. Won’t you agree with me?</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2010/08/27_fish_04.jpg" title="Mommy's artwork" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2010/08/27_fish_04.jpg" alt="Mommy's artwork" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Mommy's artwork</p>
    
</div>

<p>Of course, the little guy has always had this philosophy that “everything that mommy touches or has must be more interesting than anything else”. He took over the cotton bud and started making dots on my artwork.</p>

<p>I thought to myself, there goes my masterpiece. But hey, look what we have when he was done! A nice cloud and  raindrops… :)</p>

<p>And don’t forget about the little fish!</p>
