        <p>Obviously, the little guy still hasn’t got over his <a href="http://schooloffun.wordpress.com/2010/08/11/wait-mr-postman/">new hobby</a> of putting things into any box. When he saw me carrying an empty tissue box, he quickly snatched it. He shook the box, and took a peek inside. Then, he looked around, as if looking for something small enough to stuff his new box.</p>

<p>I gave him some clothes pegs and he was straight away one happy chap!</p>

<p>He was so excited about this whole boxing things that he started looking at the possibility of putting himself into the box, too!</p>

<p>It was kinda cute when he walked around with the box on one of his feet. He also loved the sound when he stomp his foot, together with the box.</p>

<p>Now I’m tempted to get him another box so that he could have similar boxes on both feet. Can’t wait to finish another box of tissue!!</p>
