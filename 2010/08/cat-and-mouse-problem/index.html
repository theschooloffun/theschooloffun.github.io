        <p>Believe it or not… the following is a question posed to primary school students in Singapore:</p>

<p><em>If a single cat catches two mice in three days, how many cats would it take to catch 100 mice in 30 days?</em></p>

<p>My husband and I read it on <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/">The Straits Times</a> (Saturday, Aug 28 2010). When we first saw that question, it was just as scary as watching another episode of a horror movie!</p>

<p>Of course, having completed our own primary school examination years ago, we managed to put an answer next to that question mark. Yet, we couldn’t confidently say that we would be able to answer that question if we were still in primary school.</p>

<p>But, anyway… reading that question near midnight tickled us to make jokes out of it! We concluded that the most sensible answer to that question would be:</p>

<p><strong>It depends.</strong></p>

<p>Seriously, it does! Think about the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>What if we could make the cats work overtime? Say, if we offer them more perks, maybe a single cat could catch more in less than 3 days…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What if the environmental agency intervenes? You see, 100 mice is a serious problem! You can’t simply wait for 30 days!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Shouldn’t we take into account the diminishing marginal utility? The cats might no longer care about any single mouse by the time they reach the 10th day!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What if this whole thing about cat catching mouse is considered as cruelty to animals? No, I’m not even talking about the mice. Although I’m no fan of cats, I’m concerned about the cats here! Who knows… mice could pose hazards for cats!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What types of cats and mice are we talking about here? It’s been nearly 70 years and Tom still hasn’t managed to catch Jerry!</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Hee hee… you could see how lame we’ve become by the time we listed number 5! But here’s the bottom line:</p>

<p>To all our fellow parents, good luck to all of us! If you think you’re done with all those math problems once you left your school days, think again… And it doesn’t get easier!</p>

<p>Okie… I can safely assume if, at this point, you are still scrolling down the entry, you may still be curious about the answer to the above question … :) Here’s the answer to guarantee you a good night sleep tonight:</p>

<p>It’s five. We need five cats to catch 100 mice in 30 days. You could trust me on that. That’s the model answer… :)</p>

<p>Or are you just anxious? Here’s something to make you feel better.</p>

<p>The above question was a brain teaser for primary school students to see if they qualify for Gifted Education Programme… :) Now don’t get too worried about your kids’ future. Tomorrow will take care of itself… ;)_ ___</p>
