        <p>The last time we visited IKEA, this box of chalks was among the things we bought. Nothing fancy, I’d say. But think of the possibilities of things that we could do with the chalks!</p>

<p>I know, in case you’re wondering if I had actually failed to notice, it obviously shows that the chalks are not meant for children under 3. But, well, for once, could I just decide to be a little adventurous with the little guy, while still trying my best to keep him safe? Or perhaps, it should be the other way round: keeping the chalks safe from being swallowed by my little monster? Hee hee…</p>

<p>So, off we went outside the gate. After looking at what I could do with those colorful chalks, the little guy happily took one blue chalk and started doodling next to me. He didn’t seem to mind about getting dirty! For a toddler who cries “Eeeks!” every time a drop of paint wet his fingers, that was incredible!</p>

<p>He even laughed when he saw his “blue” hand.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Something bluey on my hand!</p>
    
</div>

<p>Boy, didn’t we have so much fun with the chalks!</p>

<p>And, certainly, when you have someone who is artistic in your family, it’s just hard not to pull him in to join the fun. So, after enough nudging, I managed to get my husband to draw: an elephant!</p>

    <p class="image-caption">An artist at work</p>
    
</div>

<p>It didn’t take long for him to complete his masterpiece. The cutest elephant I’ve ever seen! The little guy added some blue streaks above the elephant’s head, too. Those streaks  turned out nice, like a splash of water on the elephant.</p>

<p>My contribution? Well.. I drew the grass… <em>_wink, wink_</em></p>

<p>The little guy, however, thought that the masterpiece was not yet completed. He took his magic blue chalk again, and started doodling again.</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2010/08/30_chalk_061.jpg" title="More bluey..." target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2010/08/30_chalk_061.jpg" alt="More bluey..." /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">More bluey...</p>
    
</div>

<p>Nevertheless, I still think the elephant, including all the out-of-place blue streaks, is worth preserving. And I mean, keeping it for a day or two. Or more… a few weeks, perhaps. A month…</p>

<p>So, you could imagine how my heart broke when my husband decided that it was time to clean up. Sob sob… time to wave bye-bye to the poor elephant… &gt;_&lt;</p>

<p>Unlike me, the little guy got excited about the whole cleaning thing. He took that pail of water and splash! There went our elephant…</p>

<p>Sob sob… give me back my elephant.</p>
