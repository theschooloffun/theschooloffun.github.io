        <p>The weather had been atrociously hot and this little guy was simply dying to go out. He was so bored that he turned cranky.</p>

<p>Say, wouldn’t it be nice to take a dip at the nearest swimming pool? Yet, I had no intention to bake him under the scorching hot sun!</p>

<p>Oh well, if we couldn’t go to the pool, we could always bring the ‘pool’ near! So, out we brought our dear ole pail. Pour in some water, and throw in some bathtub toys for more fun.</p>

<p>A paper boat would also be great… :)</p>

<p>In the end, the little guy didn’t seem to show any interest to get himself into the water. He enjoyed observing how the balls and the boat floated around. We made waves together, and waited for the boat to sink.</p>

<p>And the best thing? This whole outdoor thing, which didn’t really require us to step out of the building and walk under the sun, really floated his boat!</p>
