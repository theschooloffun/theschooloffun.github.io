        <p><em>Bah-teh-flai… bah-teh-flai…</em></p>

<p>It’s kinda difficult to encourage the little guy to say butterfly when he doesn’t see butterflies that often. Back when I was a kid, it wasn’t that tough to find butterfly. Just step outside and chances are you would get to see at least one within less than 5 minutes.There were even times when I kept caterpillars to observe the whole metamorphosis (uhm, except that I usually missed the last part.. :P butterfly flies… what do you expect?!)</p>

<p>Occasionally, we do get to see butterflies here. Not enough, though. We’ve got to count on butterfly parks to see butterflies frequent enough…</p>

<p>Hey, that calls for a craft-making time!</p>

<p><strong>What we had</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>paper plate (for the wings)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>marker</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>scissors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>food coloring</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>self-raising flour</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>salt</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>water</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>toilet roll</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>brochures/newspaper (to decorate)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>paint</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Let the Fun Begin!</strong></p>

<p>First, we prepared our puffy paint. We mixed equal amount of  self-raising flour and salt. Then we added some water to make it into paste. Using a few little drops of food coloring, we made several colors to play with.</p>

<p>We also drew 2 curves on the paper plate.</p>

<p>In case you’re wondering why we had another paper with a picture of butterfly. Well, it was more to get him used to painting with puffy paint. Trust me, for a boy who kept saying “Eekss… “ whenever he dipped his fingers inside, that was necessary! It also served well to distract him when I needed to cut the paper plate later on.</p>

<p>After a while, he found that mixing colors was more fun.</p>

<p>Hehehe.. but that doesn’t mean he didn’t proceed to the next stage, which was to paint the paper plate.</p>

<p>No doubt, it was super messy when he was done painting. That explains why I didn’t get to take any pictures. I was worried that he would start hunting the camera with his sticky fingers!</p>

<p>Anyway, basically, after cleaning up, we put the colored paper plate inside the microwave for about a few seconds. Of course, the paint instantly puffed. Nice and dry!</p>

<p>We called it a day after cutting the wings out. The following day, the little guy continued. We glued some torn brochures onto an empty toilet roll. I also helped him to stick the eyes. I was so tempted to use wiggly eyes, but I also didn’t want the wiggly eyes to drop off and end up in the little guy’s mouth.</p>

<p>We also put on 2 antennas. Now we’ve got a butterfly in the house!</p>
