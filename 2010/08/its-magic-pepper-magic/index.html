        <p>We decided to try out this <a href="http://michellesjournalcorner.blogspot.com/2010/07/preschool-science-pepper-and-dish-soap.html">Pepper and Dish Soap Experiment</a>. After reading that entry, it was just so hard to resist trying it out. I know the little guy would love it. As long as it involves water, he would definitely love to watch what I would be doing with full attention!</p>

<p>The fact that my little guy is not even 2 years old makes my life easier. At least for now, I have a valid reason why I could skip the part about explaining the science behind. Hee hee…</p>

<p>So… there we were, in the living room, ready to get wet and peppery. I let the little guy use our pepper grinder. He was so excited about it. He kept twisting and twisting, spreading pepper all over the place. Both of us sneezed a few times…</p>

<p>And when he finally got to dip his fingers and watch how the pepper floated away, he went “Wowwww…” with his cutest voice.</p>

<p>Hahaha… he must be impressed with himself! No doubt. I was very impressed, myself! I wish  they taught all this stuff back in my school days… I would probably have been a more diligent student!</p>
