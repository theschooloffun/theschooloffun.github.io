        <p>We had some bubble wraps lying around from the laptop box that my husband brought home the other day. Whenever they caught my eyes, I’d stop and pop some of the bubbles. I simply love popping bubble wraps! Too bad no one at home seems to share my excitement yet. Or maybe I should enjoy this period, before anyone fights with me for bubbles to pop!</p>

<p>Anyway, I thought I would spare some bubble wraps for the little guy and make something fun to play with… :)</p>

<p><strong>What we had</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>egg carton</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>bubble wrap (for the tentacles)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>scissors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>glue (you could also use clear tapes)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>paper (for the eyes, or you could also get some wiggle eyes)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>markers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>paint brush</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>paint</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Let the Fun Begin!</strong></p>

<p>First, we cut out one egg carton to paint. Like usual, I let the little guy do the painting.</p>

</div>

<p>Ever since I introduced him to paint brush, he seems to like it a lot. Every time he sees me taking out the brush, he gets excited. Gone has the day of finger painting! He doesn’t even like it when he has a drop of paint on his finger! He would start talking gibberish, asking me to clean it or at least, pass him a wet tissue.</p>

<p>Whenever he sees me taking out the paint bottles, he would search for the brush. He would go near the drawer where I usually keep the brush and try to reach it. Sometimes he even went all out, finding a stool to help himself reach the drawer. So, brushes he shall get… Well, I guess that’s okay, as long as he doesn’t poke anyone or any part of his body with that long brush. Of course, he thought it wouldn’t be fun if he didn’t poke  the egg carton. Like this…</p>

</div>

<p>That explains why our jellyfish has a hole on the head… :S For a while, I thought of getting another egg carton and doing it all over.</p>

<p>But, guess what, it turned out really cute after we pasted the bubble wrap tentacles and eyes! I bet it wouldn’t look as cute if the little guy didn’t poke the head! Hee hee…</p>
