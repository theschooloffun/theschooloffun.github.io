        <p>Start spreading the beans. It’s time for some bean-sorting games!</p>

<p><strong>What we had</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>a variety of beans (we used mung beans and kidney beans)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>muffin tin</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>metal container</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Red flag</strong>:</p>

<p>Every time we played with beans, I made sure I was there with the little guy for the first few  minutes. I didn’t want him to swallow any of the beans or to put inside  his nose or ears. I only stepped away from him once I was sure that he  had no interest to put the beans inside any parts of his body.</p>

<p><strong>Let the fun begin!</strong></p>

<p>We started it off by putting different beans in different muffin tin holes. In no time, the little guy was busy moving beans from one hole to another empty hole. In less than 5 minutes, we had different beans in each hole.</p>

<p>The next task was to get him to pick similar beans and put inside the metal container. It was not that difficult to get him to do just that. He seemed to be particularly interested in the kidney beans. So, he happily picked all the kidney beans and put inside the metal container. The first few times he heard the sound the bean made when it landed on the metal container, he giggled. He just looooved that ‘clang! clang!’ sound!</p>

</div>

<p>When he finished, he poured all the kidney beans back to the muffin tin. And guess what, he got a different type of ‘clang! clang!’ sound to love!</p>

<p>We play this game pretty often and he seems to like it very much. You should see how he smiles from ear to ear whenever he sees me taking out the muffin tin and the metal container!</p>

<p>This game can keep him entertained for at least half an hour. That’s pretty good for me to take a breather…<em>_wink, wink_</em> Now that certainly makes this mummy smile from ear to ear, too!</p>
