        <p>We recently watched Toy Story 3. There was a scene where Andy played with a rocket made out of a box. When I watched that, I knew I got to make something similar for the little guy!</p>

<p>So, the hunt for the right box was on ever since we stepped out of the cinema. It wasn’t that easy, I tell ya! It was either I couldn’t find the right size or I could not carry it home (it became tricky as I always have the little guy tailing me).</p>

<p>Thankfully, we didn’t really have to wait for long. It was one fine evening and my hubby brought home an empty laptop box. It was just the right size and it was light enough for the little guy to carry around.</p>

<p>So off we went to make our own rocket.</p>

<p><strong>What we had</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>empty cardboard box</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>scissors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>glue</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>paper plates</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>muffin liners</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Let the Fun Begin!</strong></p>

<p>First, we cut out one big circle in the middle. It fitted the little guy nicely. He could easily bring it up and down ‘round his waist.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Testing the Big Circle</p>
    
</div>

<p>Then, we prepared the paper plates for the wings and the muffin liners for the rocket base. I realised I should have made a cone for the top. Too bad the little guy was getting a bit impatient by then. I had no choice but to quickly get the rocket ready.</p>

<p>I thought it would look nicer if only I could have the chance to wrap it with aluminium foil! But, well, the little guy just couldn’t wait to play with it!</p>

<p>To infinity and beyond… buzz!!!</p>
