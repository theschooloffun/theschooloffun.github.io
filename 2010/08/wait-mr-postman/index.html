        <p>Been noticing that the little guy has started a new hobby: collecting small items and putting them inside anything with a hole… It was no wonder that our mailbox became one of his favorites. Every time we went downstairs to check our mailbox, he would ask me for the key and try to open the mailbox. Of course, each time I had to lift him up and help him put the key inside the keyhole. Ah…  the excitement that he showed when he found something inside… it’s contagious!</p>

<p>So, when we finally got ourselves an empty cereal box, I was so excited to start this new project with him. So excited that, in the end, I didn’t bother to paint the box like I planned earlier. We just played with it straight away!</p>

<p><strong>What we had</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>an empty cereal box</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>scissors and cutter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>old brochures or any junk mails (for the mails)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Let the Fun Begin!</strong></p>

<p>First I cut a slit in the cereal box. I made it wide enough so that he wouldn’t get frustrated trying to push the mails down through the slit. While I was cutting the slit, I let the little guy drew on the old brochures. That kept him from trying to take my scissors or cutter.</p>

<p>Next, I showed him how to put the mail in the mailbox and how we could open the mailbox and collect all the mails back. No doubt he was a fast learner! He happily pushed the mails, took out all the mails, and did it all over again. He found out how fun it was to shake the mailbox, too!</p>
