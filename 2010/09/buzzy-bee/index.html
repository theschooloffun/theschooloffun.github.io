        <p>It’s been some time since we last painted anything. Somehow the little guy lost his interest in painting… :(</p>

<p>But, it’s time to make another bug! So, out we brought our egg cartons and art kit… :)</p>

<p><strong>What we had</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>egg cartons</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>paint</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>paint brush</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>marker</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>white paper (for the wings)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>pipe cleaners</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>clear tapes</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Let the Fun Begin!</strong></p>

<p>First, we cut out two egg cartons to paint. Take a closer look on our egg cartons. You would notice that we’ve put some clear tapes on certain parts.</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2010/09/34_bee_02.jpg" title="Taping around" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2010/09/34_bee_02.jpg" alt="Taping around" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Taping around</p>
    
</div>

<p>The next part was of course, painting. Surprisingly, the little guy took the brush on his own and started painting. I guess, having been away from the brush and paint for quite some time makes him interested in painting again! :)</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2010/09/34_bee_03.jpg" title="Hello, Yellow!" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2010/09/34_bee_03.jpg" alt="Hello, Yellow!" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Hello, Yellow!</p>
    
</div>

<p>There wasn’t much to paint, actually. Yet, he was still into painting. So, he continued painting with the leftover on another piece of paper. Well, that was until he found out that the tapes on the egg cartons could be peeled off!</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2010/09/34_bee_04.jpg" title="Peeling Off" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2010/09/34_bee_04.jpg" alt="Peeling Off" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Peeling Off</p>
    
</div>

<p>He was right, anyway. The tapes were meant to be peeled off. The areas covered by the tapes were to be painted black. We didn’t use paint, though. _I _used marker. Notice it was “I”, not “We”? Well, I took over for this part, as I didn’t want our bee ended up more like a zebra. Or, worse, a black horse.</p>

<p>Next, we glued the pipe cleaners on the bee’s head.</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2010/09/34_bee_05.jpg" title="Antenna-Ready" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2010/09/34_bee_05.jpg" alt="Antenna-Ready" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Antenna-Ready</p>
    
</div>

<p>And lastly, we put on the wings. Tadaaa!</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2010/09/34_bee_07.jpg" title="Ready to buzz!" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2010/09/34_bee_07.jpg" alt="Ready to buzz!" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Ready to buzz!</p>
    
</div>

<p>Tempted to add a stinger, but well.. it might be too sharp for the little guy. So, with no stinger, our buzzy bee here is probably the friendliest bee in the neighborhood… hee heee… :)</p>
