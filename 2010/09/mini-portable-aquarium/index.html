        <p>Thanks to the public holiday on Friday, we had an awesome long weekend last week… :)</p>

<p>It was pretty an eventful weekend for all three of us, even from Thursday night! We had a wedding dinner to attend on Thursday night, a half-day seminar on Saturday morning and an outing on Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>It wasn’t the little guy’s first time to attend a wedding dinner. But I would say it might be the first time after he became so … uhm, active (although sometimes I think “active” is an understatement). True enough, being a friendly and loud little chap, he shouldn’t have any problem with the wedding dinner. There would be so much other noise that no one would actually be able to single out his noise anyway. Still, I sensed the need to get him to learn how to sit .. no, not demurely - <em>that’s probably too much to ask for</em> - … just quietly.</p>

<p>The half-day seminar was, of course, another thing to consider. I recalled that the two speakers are rather soft-spoken. Put the two of them plus our little guy in one room, and voila… you’ve got chaos!</p>

<p>So, there started our search for something fun to occupy our little guy. And look what we found at the bookstore.</p>

<p>Cute, eh? Certainly it wouldn’t be fun without the aquarium… ;)</p>

<p><strong>What we had</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>blue corrugated plastic board</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>color papers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>stickers (ours was of sea creature theme!)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>glue</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>scissors</p>
  </li>
</ol>

</div>

<p><strong>Let the Fun Begin!</strong></p>

<p>We chose blue corrugated board as that would spare us from having to color the whole board. Using the plastic board also turned out to be a great idea, as we could reuse the stickers… :)</p>

<p>We cut out the blue corrugated board to the size that can nicely fit into his toy bag. I’ll share with you about the toy bag next time… :)</p>

<p>Then, we prepared the coral, seaweed, etc to decorate our “aquarium”.</p>

<p>Although the stickers can definitely be reused after we stick them on the plastic surface, I wasn’t that sure when we first started this project. I initially even thought of lining all of them with velcro! Anyway, in the end, I lined all the stickers with glossy-surfaced cards. So, the stickers didn’t really stick on the board. The good thing is that I could show the little one how each different fish has different way of swimming. But the bad thing, they easily fall off… :(</p>

<p>The little guy obviously loves it! At least, for the first few minutes each time I take it out from the bag… :P</p>

<p>Although it didn’t really last him throughout the events on Thursday night and Saturday morning, it did keep him still for one _glorious _hour!</p>

<p>Or maybe less than an hour… I’m not sure now… :P Come to think of it, he kept switching from one toy to another. But the important thing was that he didn’t make so much noise and he didn’t go too far from us… :)</p>

<p>Any casualty, you ask? Well, on Thursday night, we lost one unidentified fish (I couldn’t even remember how it looked!). And on Saturday morning, one tiny green starfish fell down and the little guy trampled on it. It was black when I found it, so it was immediately put off-duty from our aquarium.</p>
