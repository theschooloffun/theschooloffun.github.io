        <p>Yes, we admit it. We are still into dinosaurs. And dragons.</p>

<p>And we’ve been keeping some empty cereal boxes for some fun since the last time we watched <a href="http://www.mistermaker.com/make/Cutting/Box_Puppet/step1">Mister Maker</a> on TV … :)</p>

<p><strong>What we had</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>two empty cereal boxes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>white papers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>glue</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>scissors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>paint brush</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>paint</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>clear tapes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>marker</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Let the Fun Begin!</strong></p>

<p>We first wrapped the two boxes with white papers. The reason? Well, just because we know it is important to read the food labels, it doesn’t mean we want to see any food labels all over our dino’s face… :P</p>

<p>I let the little guy take over for the next part: coloring. Check out our new crayola washable finger paints! Not as thick and vivid as our previous paint collection, but most importantly, just as washable… :) Considering how skillful our little one in splattering paints all over our sofa and walls, we always know what to look for each time we buy paint for him!</p>

<p>Once he was done, here how the boxes looked.</p>

<p>It surely looks sticky and wet, doesn’t it? We let them dry on a dryer rack for a while.</p>

<p>And while I was away to put them on the dryer rack, this was what happened to our poor toilet.</p>

<p>Lesson learnt? Never leave a toddler screaming for a tissue paper to clean his hands, even if they don’t look dirty to you. If he asks for it, let him have it. Or else, he’ll source for it somewhere else.</p>

<p>Anyway, once the boxes were dry, we put them together, using clear tapes as a hinge. We also added two eyes and two ears. We drew the nose… and there you go, our new dinosaur!</p>

<p>If you are tickled to say that it looks more like a cow that eats too much green than a dino, just keep it to yourself, will ya?! I promise I’ll draw better next time… ^_^</p>

<p>It was a great idea to use small cereal boxes, after all. They fit our little guy’s hands nicely and he loves putting his hand inside to open and close the dino’s mouth.</p>

<p>Now all we needed to do next was to engage our “puppet master”, aka my dear hubby. Trust me, he could even make our green co - uhm… dino dance!</p>
