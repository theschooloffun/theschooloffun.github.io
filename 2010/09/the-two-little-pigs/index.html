        <p>The little guy is one of those picky eaters who need to be entertained during meal times. I’m not complaining about how much or how little he eats. It’s just that it’s so difficult to keep him in his high chair.</p>

<p>So, since early this year, our dining table has changed its look into… uhm, well, like a kids’ table!</p>

<p>Other than displaying the little guy’s artworks (I’ve run out of perfect wall space  to display them…), it also has some pictures of cute farm animals and fruits. As he slowly learns to speak, these pictures turn into flashcards. He would randomly point a picture and try to impress me with any new words he learns.</p>

<p>Sometimes he scores… like when he pointed his fave fruit, banana and said, “nana…”</p>

<p>Sometimes he didn’t… like when he continued pointing at all the other pictures while still saying “nana…” Hee hee…</p>

<p>Still, not bad for an effort to make him stay seated for at least 5 more minutes…</p>

<p>Until, one day, he pointed to one picture of a pinkish piglet and while putting on his cheekiest smile, said “mama…”</p>

<p>Ouch… <em>_speechless_</em>…</p>

<p>Hahaha… Kids say the darndest things, don’t they! Was it because I was wearing pink ? Or maybe that’s how I should know if I’ve been eating or acting like a pig.. :P</p>

<p>Anyway, since he was into piglet, why not make something <em>piglet-y</em>?</p>

<p><strong>What we had</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>egg cartons</p>

<p><strong>Let the Fun Begin!</strong></p>

<p>First, we cut out the egg cartons. The next step was of course, his favorite: coloring.</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2010/09/31_pig_02.jpg" title="Red here, red there" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2010/09/31_pig_02.jpg" alt="Red here, red there" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Red here, red there</p>
    
</div>

<p>Notice that we had 2 egg cartons? Yup, that’s right. We painted 2 egg cartons red. I know, it’s supposed to be pink for piglet. I was just so excited to start that I forgot about mixing in some white.</p>

<p>And, there you go, the first egg carton: Pretty Piglet</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2010/09/31_pig_04.jpg" title="Oink!" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2010/09/31_pig_04.jpg" alt="Oink!" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Oink!</p>
    
</div>

<p>And here’s the second one: a piglet’s snout!</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2010/09/31_pig_03.jpg" title="Snout! Snout!" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2010/09/31_pig_03.jpg" alt="Snout! Snout!" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Snout! Snout!</p>
    
</div>

<p>The two rubber bands on the side of the snout are for easy wear. Too bad it wasn’t really that easy to get the little guy to pose with the snout. He ran away whenever I slipped one of the rubber bands on his ear.</p>

<p>If I could just trick him to wear the snout long enough to take a better picture… :S</p>
