        <p>This is probably the saddest looking car. Ever.</p>

<p>A kind person gave it to us from a thrift store. It wasn’t in prime condition when it was passed to us. Yet, it still looked great! It was also easy to identify the car as a highway patrol, with the lights on the roof of the car. It immediately won the little guy’s heart, especially with the doors and the trunk lid that could be opened.</p>

<p>The little guy toted the car about with him nearly every time we went out. It was also his fave on the <a href="http://schooloffun.wordpress.com/2010/08/28/race-me-if-you-dare/">racing track</a>. Of course, it also means that the car endures hard time. It had suffered countless serious falls from a height and it had smashed nearly every wall in our house.</p>

<p>Now, the trunk lid is no longer there. Forget about the lights, too. They went missing on the second day.</p>

<p>Still, the little guy loves it. Although he doesn’t really bring it around anymore, he often plays with it at home.</p>

<p>And we thought it would be great to pay our tribute to this amazing car by taking it in one of our art sessions… :)</p>

<p><strong>What we had</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>drawing paper</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>paint</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>car</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cookie cutter</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Let the Fun Begin!</strong></p>

<p>We first put the paint on a cookie tray, our favorite palette… :P With a little encouragement, the little guy then let his car roll in the paint, getting all the four wheels wet with paint. He probably thought it was strange that for the first time ever, his mommy asked him to put the car on something sticky!</p>

<p>After seeing how I drove the car all over the paper, he took over the car and started painting with it.</p>

<p>It was messy. Really messy. The little guy also used his little fingers every now and then.</p>

<p>Don’t worry about the car. It wasn’t difficult at all to clean it after we finished painting.</p>

<p>He somehow left the left side empty. It was good, though. I was thinking of getting him to try painting with the cookie cutter, too.</p>
