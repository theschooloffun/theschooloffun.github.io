        <p>School of Fun had just had a visitor: our little guy’s cousin from Japan… :) So, for the past few days, we took a break from making crafts. The two boys quickly declared themselves as partners-in-crime, ransacking the whole house. Haha… :D</p>

<p>Still, it was fun watching them together playing … and fighting. I guess our little guy still learned something during this “break” after all. He seemed to enjoy the company of someone of about the same size as him and as cheeky as him.</p>

<p>Now that the cousin had gone home, it was all quiet at home. Well, except for that Shinkansen’s announcement that came out from the bullet trains miniature that he gave to our little guy. Considering that it is something new in the house, the little guy kept playing with it, day and night. He would turn on the train and let it roam around.</p>

<p>The fact that the train carries 3 cars also make it more fun to play with. The little guy would swing one to the left, while turning the other one to move forward in another direction. And the other one? That is for mommy to find… &gt;_&lt; Yup, sadly, we could rarely see all the 3 cars link together. You see, it’s always easier to detach the 3 cars than to attach them. Go figure! As soon as we link the three cars, the little guy would be happy to detach them…</p>

<p>Anyway, since the little guy kept insisting that it was a car and not a train, I decided to built a track from old boxes. I thought the track would show the obvious difference between a car and a train.</p>

<p>We also took the train’s box to make a longer track. I guess it’ll grow longer if we could find more boxes… :P</p>

<p>The track was indeed awesome! It gets even more fun when we put one side higher and let the train travel down the slope.</p>

<p>So, has the little guy started calling it a train, you ask? Nope. He still insists that it is a car, just like any other friction-powered car he has. Hee hee… :P In his dictionary, the only train he knows is that big, long <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Rapid_Transit_%28Singapore%29">MRT </a>we could see from our windows.</p>
