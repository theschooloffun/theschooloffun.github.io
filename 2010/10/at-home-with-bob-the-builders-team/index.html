        <p>Our days have been pretty exciting lately, especially with the construction going on near our place… :)</p>

</div>

<p>Every day, it is like waking up to watch Bob the Builder shows.  Or even better! Yeah, it probably even beats watching Bob the Builder Live Performance!</p>

<p>So, every day, anywhere near our windows becomes the little guy’s favorite hangout place. He would climb or simply peek through the window to see all the heavy duty vehicles.</p>

<p>Of course, being a fan of Bob the Builder myself thanks to the many weekends spent on waking up early to watch the show with the little guy, I would happily spend some time with him there. We would count the trucks, point and even name them one by one using the name of the most similar character from Bob the Builder… <em>_grinz_</em></p>

<p>There is Roley the steamroller, although he is yellow, not green like on TV. We also saw Tumbler the concrete transport truck the other day, yet again not as colorful as on TV. Then there are Grabber the excavator and Muck the front loader, too.  And maybe, Lofty the crane. Okie, not sure for that one… we haven’t really mastered our truck vocabulary. Hee hee..</p>

<p>Now, if we look more carefully, sometimes we would spot some “Bob”s with their yellow helmets, too. Not all the construction workers wear yellow helmets, that’s why…</p>

<p>Our favorite is of course Roley, since it is the easiest to spot and name. And also because of his favorite phrase “Rock and roll!”.</p>

<p>Told you it’s exciting! Ha!</p>
