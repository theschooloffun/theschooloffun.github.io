        <p>What we’re about to show you took us many days to complete! Nearly two weeks, in fact!</p>

<p>Of course, the first few days went by with the box just sitting idly at one corner. That probably what you could expect from someone who would still be holding on to the previous Saturday’s newspaper until the following Thursday, trying to finish reading it before the following Saturday comes.</p>

<p>Yeah… we were _that _busy… bwahaha… Oh well, maybe it was more because I wanted to find that precious time when I would not be too busy to play with the cutter and scissors. But then, such time would usually be when I have the little guy so near that he could just poke his fingers around.</p>

<p>Then, miraculously I found that perfect time to cut one side of the box! And there you go… the box sat idly once again for another couple of days as the little guy insisted on using the box as the parking area for his cars and trucks. And oh, for <a href="http://schooloffun.wordpress.com/2010/10/19/374/">his new train</a>, too…</p>

<p>So, you could imagine the excitement when we finally managed to turn the box into something that we, err, I wanted! Tadaaa…</p>

<p>Nope, we didn’t bother to paint it. Or rather, we didn’t have the chance to paint it. Our little guy decided to quickly snatch the role of the giant happily stomping the castle. Uhm, maybe he simply wants to be the kindhearted giant who lives happily ever after in a castle, leaving no space for Cinderella or any other princesses in any of our fairy tales… hee hee…</p>

<p>And when he’s done playing as a giant, he would ensure that the castle serves its “real” purpose according to him: parking area. Hahaha…</p>
