        <p>Help.</p>

<p>Our house has been turning into a thrift store lately…&gt;_&lt; Or, at least, almost. We have tons of second-hand goods. All we need to do now to qualify as a thrift store is just to start selling. Hee hee…</p>

<p>My dear hubby brought home an old typewriter last weekend. There is no more ink on the ribbon. Otherwise, it’s still working perfectly.</p>

<p>The good thing is that it immediately wins the little guy’s heart. Every now and then he would sit in front of the typewriter and start playing with the keytops. His favorite is, of course, the automatic space bar, which is the easiest to press.</p>

<p>But, today, we thought of doing something different with the typewriter. We invited our soft toys for a pretend play. We pretended that we were in the office. We got our soft toys together on the sofa and dressed our bears and duck up. We also brought along our typewriter.</p>

<p>The little guy got very excited to see all of them well dressed. So, he asked to wear his shirt, too. Luckily, he didn’t ask for any bow tie or shawl like what the bears wear.</p>

<p>Next, being a super-friendly colleague, he taught his “colleagues” how to use the typewriter. Hee hee… I love the serious face he put as he started his lecture.</p>
