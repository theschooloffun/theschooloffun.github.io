        <p>Uhm, okay… probably not the real kitchen. We can’t bring the sofa to the kitchen, so we bring the “kitchen” to the sofa… :)</p>

<p>Monday is usually a hectic day. After all the fun and excitement during the weekend, we usually have lots of things to clean, wash, iron and the list continues. Sometimes, being tired after having less sleep during the weekend, the little guy turns rather cranky, too. And that adds… no, not just adding; it multiplies the workload!</p>

<p>That is why on this particular Monday, when I saw him so engrossed watching his favorite show, Hi-5, I quickly took the bean sprouts to the living room. Although I like bean sprouts and I do know that they are healthy, I am no big fan of cooking bean sprouts. It is simply because of those wiggly ends that I’d rather remove before eating. I just can’t imagine myself eating them. So, you could imagine the effort to snip these if I buy a pack of bean sprouts! No fun at all.</p>

<p>Anyway, there I was at the living room, faithfully snipping one after another, when suddenly the little guy started looking. Obviously there was no more music for him to dance to as the Hi-5 show just ended. He observed what I was doing and finally took one bean sprout. And snip. Then another bean sprout. And snip…</p>

<p>It turned out to be a great activity! He actually enjoyed snipping the bean sprouts for about 15 minutes or so. We found ourselves chatting over the bean sprout snipping and when he suddenly started that contagious laughing craze, we couldn’t stop laughing!</p>

<p>Not bad. In the end, we had one busy and happy toddler, one happy mommy (at least that snipping wasn’t that boring) and bean sprouts for dinner! And nope, considering his age that is way below the legal age, I didn’t find anyone knocking at our door for this “child labor”… <em>_grinz_</em></p>

<p>Finally, as a token of appreciation, I let him be a soldier for the day, complete with the helmet, stick and tent… :D</p>
