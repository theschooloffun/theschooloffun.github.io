        <p>It’s Halloween time! And there’s no better way to entertain a toddler than a dress-up game! The toddler got to play make believe in the most interesting way, while the mommy got tons of photos to laugh at… <em>_grinz_</em></p>

<p>It didn’t start with a breeze, though. The futile attempt to dress him like a mummy using toilet paper turned him unfriendly at first. Until he saw his own face with the monster hat… he became very cooperative! He even tried to dress up himself. I guess he started to think that whatever his mommy was doing, she was definitely up to do something exciting with him!</p>

<p>Well, we surely did get to do lots of exciting things! Check out what other costumes we had!</p>

<p><strong>The Back-to-School/Back-to-Work Scarecrow</strong></p>

<p>They said school and office could be pretty horrifying. So, the little guy wanted to be the hero who would flap his arms to scare the ghosts, including all the evil bullies… :)</p>

<p>Impressed? You know who to call then if you’re dealing with one at work or school!</p>

<p><strong>Supertot</strong></p>

<p>What? A hero needs a cape? No problem. Everything’s under control. We’ve got the cape and the Supertot is ready to take off. We’ve got to warn you, though: do not try this at home! Especially not without anything to cushion the superhero-wanna-be… you never know when and where he would jump!</p>

<p><strong>Mickey Mouse</strong></p>

<p>Okie, enough with the superheroes. The world doesn’t need another superhero.  The world needs to giggle more, so the little guy turn himself into a… cute Mickey Mouse!</p>

    Sing with me: M-I-C-K-E-Y  M-O-U-S-E!</p>

<p><strong>The Uke Player</strong></p>

<p>Speaking about singing and music, what do you think about dressing smart as an ukulele player? Who knows, he might have what it takes to be the next <a href="http://www.jakeshimabukuro.com/?t=bio">Jake Shimabukuro</a>.</p>

<p>Oh, by the way, this was probably the most terrifying scene during the game. I watched in horror as he plucked the strings with all his might and main! :S</p>

<p><strong>The Little Green Riding Hood</strong></p>

<p>Move aside, Little Red Riding Hood! Green is the new red! Oops… no matching shoes? It’s okay, we’ll make do with mommy’s turquoise socks… :) And nope, we don’t need that basket to bring food for the grandmother in the fairy tale. Let’s just sing for grandmother. She’ll recover soon when she hears the little guy sing… ;)</p>
