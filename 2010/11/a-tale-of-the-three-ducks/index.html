        <p>It’s just hard not to think about ducks when it’s raining heavily the whole morning. Like this morning… Somehow it brought back the memories of those rainy days when I was much younger. Usually, on my way back from the bus stop to home, there would be ducks (or perhaps geese… I couldn’t really tell the difference back then) waddling around the puddles. They weren’t as cute as Donald Duck, but still… they made a great entertainment.</p>

<p>Anyway, as the little guy started to show his frustration for not being able to go out due to the weather, out we brought our paints.</p>

<p>Our theme for today was, of course, duck. One of the little guy’s favorite songs is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LEYwoooVfw">Elmo’s Ducks</a>. So, I thought it would be great if we could make something which later on we could play with while singing that song together.</p>

<p><strong>What we had</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>drawing paper</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>colorful papers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>paints</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>paint brush</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>glue</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cookie cutter (duck shape, of course!)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Let the Fun Begin!</strong></p>

<p>We cut out three little paper ducks**. **Next, I put a bit of glue on the paper ducks and placed them on the drawing paper.</p>

<p>Somehow, I thought there were only three ducks in the song. By the time I realised that there are supposed to be four ducks, the little guy had got down to business, painting with all his might and main.</p>

<p>First, he used a paintbrush.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Brushing the ducks</p>
    
</div>

<p>Getting really excited, he put down his paintbrush and used his right hand to continue painting.</p>

<p>It seemed that he really enjoyed it. It became a kind of whack-the-duck games in which he had to whack each duck as many times as possible… :P</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2010/11/59_duck_04.jpg" title="Whack the Duck!" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2010/11/59_duck_04.jpg" alt="Whack the Duck!" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Whack the Duck!</p>
    
</div>

<p>Occasionally, he took the paintbrush and used it. Then, he put it down and started his whack-the-duck game again.</p>

<p>At the end of the whacking games, here’s what we got:</p>

    <a href="/uploads/2010/11/59_duck_05.jpg" title="The Three Wacky Ducks" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2010/11/59_duck_05.jpg" alt="The Three Wacky Ducks" /></a>

</div>

<p>I guess I could just forget about turning it into something to play with as we sing the song. My initial plan was not to have the ducks attached to the paper. That was why I only put a bit of glue on the paper ducks. Yet, probably because the little guy kept on whacking the ducks earlier, it became really hard to detach them without tearing the paper… :S</p>

<p>So much for thinking that we could sing the song and take one duck out each time each duck in the song goes missing… :P</p>

<p>I guess the three ducks are here to stay then… :) So here’s our version of the song… Quack!</p>

<p><em>Elmo had three ducks (quack quack quack)</em><br />
_ three birds of a feather (quack quack quack)_<br />
_ to waddle with (quack quack quack)_<br />
_ and quack together (quack quack quack)_<br />
_ But then one day… **none **swam away_<br />
_ Oh gosh oh gee… Elmo **still **had three!_</p>
