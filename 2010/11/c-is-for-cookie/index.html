        <p>Two weeks ago, thanks to my dear hubby’s brilliant idea, we celebrated our special 10-11 day in the most exciting way!</p>

<p>We went all the way to Bukit Timah area to check out the new shop, <a href="http://www.tottstore.com/">ToTT (Tools of the Trade)</a>. We had a quick lunch at the bistro inside. And, to our pleasant surprise, they actually have an indoor playground next to the bistro! So, of course, it was kinda like a treat for the little guy, too, even though it was _our _special day… :)</p>

<p>While the little guy occupied himself at the playground, I enjoyed a stroll along the aisles, admiring all the culinary related products. Luckily, we did have a plan to go somewhere else in the afternoon. Otherwise, I might turn shopaholic at the sight of those cute cookie cutters and baking trays!</p>

<p>Seriously, I also think that housing an indoor playground there is such a wise idea. With so many fragile items around, I couldn’t imagine if I let the little guy walk on his own there!</p>

<p>Our favorite section was the Bake &amp; Go counter. Finally, my dream of baking cookies with the little guy came true! It took us less than 30 minutes, not so bad for someone with a fairly short attention span like him. And, guess what, it couldn’t get any better than this: no clean up was required!</p>

<p>The staff at the counter was very friendly, too. Ah, what am I saying?! _All _the staff there were friendly throughout our visit… :) The little guy smiled from cheek to cheek the moment he stepped in! Mind you, he even gave one of them a big hug near the entrance!</p>

<p>Anyway, the staff at the counter helped our little guy in his very first cookie baking session, while I got carried away enjoying it myself… (I know… shame on me! :P )  She stacked 2 stools to prop him up so that he could reach the counter. Then, she guided him to place the dough and flatten it.</p>

<p>The hardest part for the little guy was to wait while we baked the cookies. He kept on staring at the oven, probably wondering why the cookies had to go inside and why everyone screamed at him whenever he wanted to check on the cookies…</p>

<p>Actually, he only needed to wait for about less than 15 minutes. Yet, I guess, after all the excitement at the indoor playground, he just couldn’t take it anymore. He fell asleep before the cookies were ready.</p>

<p>Now, take a look at our freshly baked cookies… and the cute tin (on the left). I still remember how the sweet smell lingered, stirring up our appetites. Hhhhmmmm….</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Yummy, yummy...</p>

<p>I guess it was good that the little guy had fallen asleep then. Otherwise, he would surely have finished everything before we got the chance to put the cookies into the tin! Hee hee…</p>

<p>We let him have his share when we were at home in the afternoon. And his verdict? <em>Yummy, yummy</em>!</p>
