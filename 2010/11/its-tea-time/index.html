<p>The guests have flocked around, too. It’s party time! :)</p>

<p>Yup, we’re inviting all of them for a tea time… :)</p>

<p>Remember when I said that that second-hand fun-ominoes thing was <a href="http://schooloffun.wordpress.com/2010/11/06/confessions-of-a-hoarder/">a good investment</a>? Well, it _really _has been a good investment… :) In our last make-believe play, we used the colorful bits for the “food”. The little guy happily took the role of a good host, serving each of his guest with some yummy tidbits. Although at first he insisted on giving each of them exactly only 2 pieces, he ended up playing favorites. He gave more pieces to his beloved duck… :P It’s either he wanted the duck to quickly grow to be as big as the bears or he was simply too lazy to move his butt to serve the others… :P I’d rather think it’s the first one. Hahaha….</p>

<p>Of course, what is a tea time without cakes (although, actually, we totally forgot about serving tea… hehehe!). Here’s the chef, preparing the cakes… :)</p>

<p>Being a good host, the little guy always wants to make sure everyone have a great time. So, he added in the “entertainment” part… :P And how did he do it? By simply putting the pan in front of his face and clowning around…bwahaha!</p>

<p>We really had a blast! Even when the “party” ended… Just take a look at what the little guy did when I asked him to tidy up. He stacked all the plates nicely and put everything around in one “circle”. Although he seemed to forget about keeping his guests and putting them back in the rack, he brought the bear and the duck to the “circle”. And here’s my favorite: he put the blanket on the bear!!! Hahaha… maybe he thought that the bear had fallen asleep after eating so much! Very thoughtful of him! Hahaha…</p>
