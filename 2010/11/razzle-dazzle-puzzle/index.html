<p>You see, I’ve been thinking of getting the little guy a jigsaw puzzle. Yet, I know I’m not ready to lose my mind over the lost pieces.</p>

<p>I guess I wouldn’t mind losing any piece from this jigsaw puzzle we’ve made. Or so I think…</p>

<p><strong>What we had</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>cardboard</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>glue</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>scissors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a picture (from a magazine, in our case)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Let the Fun Begin!</strong></p>

<p>After cutting out the picture from the magazine, we made a frame using the cardboard. We made sure the picture could fit in nicely.</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2010/11/60_puzzle_02.jpg" title="The Frame" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2010/11/60_puzzle_02.jpg" alt="The Frame" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">The Frame</p>
    
</div>

<p>Next, we pasted the picture on another cardboard, to make the puzzle pieces slightly thicker… :) At least then I wouldn’t need to worry that the pieces would not survive after being bitten, tossed around, etc.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Ready for the wear and tear</p>
    
</div>

<p>Finally, I cut the picture into smaller pieces.</p>

<p>And here’s our first jigsaw puzzle… :)</p>

<p>Don’t ask me to take a picture of the little guy playing it. Right now, he only likes to throw the pieces around. Although he does try to help putting the pieces together, he enjoys the feeling of having the pieces fly around… :P</p>

<p>I asked my husband to give the jigsaw puzzle a try in the evening. Even though later on my husband could put the pieces together in a jiffy, he did look puzzled at first. So, I guess the jigsaw puzzle might still be too complex for the little guy… :P So, well… I’ll wait until the little guy can really enjoy playing the puzzle. As for now, I just hope I can handle the “excitement” as he throws around the pieces…. <em>_crossing my fingers so that there would **still **be 8 pieces later on_</em></p>
