        <p>When you stay in an island country like Singapore, you are simply bound to go abroad at least once in your lifetime. This school holiday season, again, it is like a phenomenon in which many parents bring their school-going kids to take a holiday abroad all together. Our little guy hasn’t gone to any preschool yet, but we decided to join these parents.</p>

<p>Without much planning, we packed our suitcase and a travel book, while praying fervently that everything would turn out fine. Surely, you’ve heard about all the hassles traveling with a toddler, haven’t you?</p>

<p>We put our fear aside and braved the 3.5 hour journey. Our destination? Macau… :)</p>

<p>Yet, bringing the little guy proved to be like hauling a 24-hour entertainment-on-the-go. Notice the word “hauling” there? Well, he simply refused anyone else to carry him. I think I’ve built more muscles throughout our days there from carrying him and my bulky camera. Made me feel like a super woman… Ha! Heee heee… :P</p>

<p>Still, like I said earlier, our trip wouldn’t be fun without him. True enough, we went to catch the famous <a href="http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/en/welcome.aspx">Cirque du Soleil</a> there. Yet, it was the little guy’s daring stunt that made us hold our breath most of the time. Like when he scampered from one end to another on a seesaw…. &gt;<em>&lt; *_gasp</em>*</p>

<p>Our little guy was very helpful, too. He always made sure that we brought our luggage. Whenever and wherever we went. Even later on after we had settled in our hotel room for the night… :P</p>

<p>And when indeed we needed to bring along our luggage, he went the extra mile. He didn’t mind pulling our luggage even though it was bigger than him!</p>

<p>His curiosity was amazing. He made us look at all the little things that we would otherwise fail to admire… :)</p>

<p>When mealtime came, he would be the first to alert us to quickly find a place to eat. And yup, he never seems to be out of idea when it comes to showing us the best way to enjoy a meal. Like when he enjoyed his oodles of noodles…</p>

<p>Best of all, just because we were on holiday, it didn’t mean that the learning experience had to stop. Just take a look at our budding photographer!</p>

<p>And finally, he made sure that we stayed in touch, using the technology, even though we were away… :)</p>
