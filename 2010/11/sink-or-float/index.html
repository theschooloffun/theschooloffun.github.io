        <p>Unless you fell asleep during class the majority of the time, you probably have heard about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buoyancy">buoyancy</a>[](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buoyancy). If that still doesn’t ring a bell, I hope the name Archimedes does… :)</p>

<p>Recently, the little guy includes testing for buoyancy as one of his antics. He simply loves to throw any object he could find into a glass of water and see whether it sinks or floats. If it floats, he would use his fingers to push the object down  and giggle when it floats again.</p>

<p>After dealing with water spill every now and then, I decided that this little scientist of mine simply had to be entertained. We had a variety of fruits and veggies at home and a clear plastic ‘pail’. Just add water, and voila… let the fun begin!</p>

<p>We had carrot, blueberry, banana, plum and apple, which the little guy happily put inside the pail of water one by one. And guess which one floats!</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the small blueberry sank, while the big banana and apple floated. As expected, the little guy kept pushing the banana and apple down. He just loved to see them floating back! He nearly didn’t let me take a picture from above. How could I resist the temptation to take a picture when it was this colorful?!</p>

<p>Later on, we also put in the little guy’s rubber duckie and a small toothpaste. Both of them floated, adding more entertainment for the little guy.</p>

<p>At the end of this fun activity, I was pretty sure I didn’t have a new brilliant scientist, not even an expert in Archimedes’ principles, in the house. But, surely, I had one happy, though drenched, toddler. Of course, happy toddler = happy mummy.</p>

<p>While he got excited with the floating and sinking stuff, I also managed to tend our garden, which looked quite pathetic after we left it for nearly a week. So, that means, happy toddler = happy mummy = happy plants.</p>

<p>And here’s the icing on the cake: the little guy helped me to water the plants using the clear pail… :) Isn’t that great?!</p>
