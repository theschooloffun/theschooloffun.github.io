        <p>…and you’ll get at least (almost) half an hour of fun! :)</p>

<p>Of course, not just beans. Throw in a muffin tin or other container to add the elements of fun. Frankly, it’s been some time since I last used my muffin tin as… well, a real muffin tin. Yet, I still think that this muffin tin has proven to be a good investment after all!</p>

<p>Remember <a href="http://schooloffun.wordpress.com/2010/12/16/the-green-water-project/ ‎">The Green Water Project</a> that we just had the other day? It turned out that the little guy still likes playing with the measuring cups and spoons. So, we counted them in… ;)</p>

</div>

<p>Here how it went: the little guy scooped some beans from the plastic container and dropped them into the muffin tin. He used different spoons each time, but I don’t think he was aware that there was a difference in the number of beans he could spoon with a different spoon yet. He just loved scooping and the  “clang, clang” sound every time he dropped the beans into the tin.</p>

<p>He also added another variation to this activity by including his favorite Chuck the Dump Truck… hee hee… :P</p>

<p>Too bad this activity couldn’t keep the little guy occupied for a long time, like in <a href="http://schooloffun.wordpress.com/2010/12/16/the-green-water-project/%20%E2%80%8E">The Green Water Project</a>. I sensed that it was probably because I interfered too much. You see, I supervised him closely while he was playing with the beans as I was afraid that any of those beans might end inside his nose, ears or mouth. I don’t fancy the idea of rushing the little guy to the emergency room… :P Every time he made a suspicious movement, for example touching his ears, I asked him to show me his hands. I guess that frustrated him after a while… :P</p>

<p>Oh well… better safe than sorry.</p>
