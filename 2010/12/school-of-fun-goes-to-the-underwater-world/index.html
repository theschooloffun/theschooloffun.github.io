        <p>Who, in her right mind, would choose to visit a popular tourist spot on a holiday season?! I certainly have lost my mind when I decided to bring the whole clan to the <a href="http://www.underwaterworld.com.sg/">Underwater World Sentosa</a> that Monday.</p>

<p>Defending myself wasn’t that difficult, though… :P The lure of the “Pay like a Child, Play like a Child” promotion plus the promise we had made to bring the little guy there as his birthday gift were certainly the factors that brought us there… :P</p>

<p>As you could have guessed, it was very crowded. So crowded that we could barely move around to see the fishes. Still, we could tell that the little guy enjoyed himself. His favorite? The tunnel! :) We went inside many times… :P</p>

<p>The little guy also seemed interested to touch the stingrays in the  touch pool. Yet, again, it was too crowded to make room for him to touch  any.</p>

<p>The Fur Seals LIVE and Meet-the-Dolphins sessions were certainly a hit. We got ourselves a nice place to sit and watch about one hour before the sessions. So, this time round, we could enjoy ourselves without being squeezed from left and right… :) And the seals and dolphins? We just wish we could bring them home!</p>

<p>I guess we should go there again next time.. :) <em>_dropping a BIG hint_</em></p>
