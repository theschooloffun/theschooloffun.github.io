        <p>Seriously, most of the time, it doesn’t take expensive toys to entertain a toddler. But most of the time, it takes a lot of plan Bs (or Cs, and so on).</p>

<p>Just like the other day when I found out that he wasn’t interested at all in making this Christmas tree… I thought making a Christmas tree together would entertain him. Yet, in fact, he was actually more interested in pulling the card boards apart…&gt;_&lt;</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2010/12/71_water_05.jpg" title="Uh-oh Christmas Tree!" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2010/12/71_water_05.jpg" alt="Uh-oh Christmas Tree!" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Uh-oh Christmas Tree!</p>
    
</div>

<p>So, since he has been showing interest in playing with glasses and water lately, I let him play while I tried to finish making the Christmas tree… :)</p>

<p>I brought out the big, wide pail and went to find my measuring cups. To make it more interesting, I also dyed the water green. He watched closely as the dye dissolved in water. Trust me, even at this stage, I knew that I had won his heart!</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Turning the water green</p>
    
</div>

<p>I put all the measuring cups inside the big pail. That way, there would be less mess to deal with after this activity… :)</p>

    <a href="/uploads/2010/12/71_water_02.jpg" title="Ready to measure" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2010/12/71_water_02.jpg" alt="Ready to measure" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Ready to measure</p>
    
</div>

<p>And of course, he didn’t need much instruction to start playing around with those cups…</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2010/12/71_water_03.jpg" title="Water.. here, there and everywhere" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2010/12/71_water_03.jpg" alt="Water.. here, there and everywhere" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Water.. here, there and everywhere</p>
    
</div>

<p>For a good thirty minutes, he sat there, moving the water around from one container to another using different measuring cups. Good enough for me to get other things done! Ha! &gt;:D</p>

<p>Things got even more interesting when I let him use a syringe. He giggled and squirted the green water (into the pail, thankfully) … :D</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Squirt.. squirt...</p>
    
</div>

<p>Hmm.. maybe I should let him experiment with other colors, too… :D Mixing colors, etc… I’d say, it would be really fun!!!</p>
