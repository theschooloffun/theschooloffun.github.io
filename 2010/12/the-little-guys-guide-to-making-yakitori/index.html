        <p>Somehow, last week’s dinner menu included satay and yakitori. Both included grilling and most importantly, skewers. On these two different days, the little guy observed me closely as I soaked the skewers in water and threaded the meat pieces onto the skewers. He seemed very interested…</p>

<p>No doubt, given a skewer, he would straight away give me a free demo, showing me that he, too, could do that interesting thing that seemed to keep me occupied, instead of playing with him. Of course, giving him a real skewer is never a good idea. So, I gave him a chopstick and watched him carefully as he played around with it, along with Play Doh.</p>

<p>He was so excited when I gave him “balls” of Play Doh. Chef Little Guy quickly threaded the balls onto the skewer.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Threading... one, two, three...</p>
    
</div>

<p>Of course, the fun didn’t stop there. He then took out all the balls from the skewer and flattened some of them using his hands.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Smash!</p>
    
</div>

<p>Next, he took one of his fave fire truck and pressed it against one of the flattened balls. I think he liked to see the mark left behind by the truck since he then took another car and a figurine to press against another flattened play doh.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Vroom...</p>
    
</div>

<p>When all had been properly “marked”, he took them one by one and yes, threaded them onto the skewer again… :) Apparently, he wanted the yakitori to have a different look from the first yakitori he made! Hee hee… I guess, next time I should give him more than just one skewer and lend him my grill pan!</p>
