        <p>Another year has passed and it’s time to unwrap another gift… :)</p>

<p>Life is certainly a gift and our little guy has just celebrated his 2nd birthday. Sadly, he was down with fever on his big day. We had to cancel most of the things we had planned out for him.</p>

<p>Yet, to him, the fever was no valid reason to skip all the tradition. Being sick is no reason _not _to celebrate this gift of life. So, he unwrapped his present, clapped as we sang happy birthday for him, “made his wishes” and blew the candles on his (slice of) cake. Of course, he wrapped everything up by finishing the slice of cake… ;)</p>
