        <p>After days of grueling battle thanks to a damaged graphic card, we’re finally back! I didn’t joke when I said ‘grueling’, as this broken desktop really resulted in one frustrated toddler for not being able to get his daily dose of 10-min Thomas and Friends or Chuggington. Geee…! Worse, at his age, he really doesn’t do math at all. Even half an hour’s worth of Chuggington on TV couldn’t seem to appease him! :S</p>

<p>Anyway, as my husband brought home quite a number of dinosaur-themed children books from the library last weekend, we dedicated one of those grueling days as Dino’s Day… :)</p>

<p>To add to the elements of fun, I thought of sewing something for the little guy to wear. Knowing that he is no fan to wearing anything too tight, I decided to sew a simple dino’s tail.</p>

<p>Guess what? He wasn’t interested at all. He refused to wear it! Or at least, at first… :P</p>

<p>After much persuasion that included dressing up Frosty the Bear (and myself!) and reading the little guy lots of dinosaurs books while telling him how their tails could sway left and right, he relented!</p>
