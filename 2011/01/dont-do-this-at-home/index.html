        <p>The other day, when I was busy preparing some carrots for the dinner, the little guy kept bugging me. Not the usual ‘play-with-me-instead’ kind of bugging, mind you. He persistently asked me to let him do the honor of cutting the carrots!</p>

<p>At first, it freaked me out to notice that he has started to get interested in this whole cutting thingy. Even after I left him to keep the cutting board and the knife, he still insisted on asking me to let him play with the carrots.</p>

<p>In the end, I decided to take the leap of faith. I let him use a blunt plastic knife - the most blunt that I could find. I knew it should be pretty harmless. Still, I did not dare to take my eyes off him as he explored his new tool and ‘grated’ my rock-like carrots!</p>

<p>Obviously, while his mommy was at the verge of having a heart attack, the little guy enjoyed every learning moment. Thankfully, he proved to be extremely careful in handling  the knife. Nevertheless, he attempted to hold the knife with his left hand, instead of his right hand, a few times. Ha! A daredevil, indeed!</p>

<p>Now a master in cutting, he then sallied forth into the world of a tea time chef. Yup, he proudly prepared his own snack. I think his mommy can soon retire… <em>_grinz_</em></p>
