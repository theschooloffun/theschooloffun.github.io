        <p>The last time we did our ‘spring cleaning’, we realised that we’ve collected quite a number of the little guy’s paintings. There are simply so many of them that putting them up on the walls would mean cluttering the walls. So, instead, we used them as table mats … :)</p>

<p>We didn’t get them laminated, so they were more for the little guy and his gang to play with. At the same time, I wanted to teach him how to set the table. So, here’s how we accomplished all of them… ;)</p>

<p>First, I let him help me trace to mark where to put what.</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/01/86_eat_01.jpg" title="Tracing is ON!" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/01/86_eat_01.jpg" alt="Tracing is ON!" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Tracing is ON!</p>
    
</div>

<p>Of course, in the end, he was much more interested in playing with the marker. When he started to draw on the floor, I quickly took over and completed the tracing for him before the marker claimed more casualties. Hee hee… :P</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/01/86_eat_02.jpg" title="What We Traced..." target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/01/86_eat_02.jpg" alt="What We Traced..." /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">What We Traced...</p>
    
</div>

<p>Next, I showed him how to set the table. He then set another one on the other side.</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/01/86_eat_03.jpg" title="How to Set the Table" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/01/86_eat_03.jpg" alt="How to Set the Table" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">How to Set the Table</p>
    
</div>

<p>At first, I thought I would be his lunch buddy. Yet, apparently, he preferred Frosty the Bear. Mommy was out from his list! &gt;_&lt;</p>

    <p class="image-caption">VIP Seat: Frosty the Bear</p>
    
</div>

<p>By then, the little guy had been truly enjoying the whole thing. He started asking me for something to eat. Hehehe, what had I been thinking… why setting the table if there was nothing to eat?!</p>

<p>When I placed his lunch on top of the paper plate, he quickly said grace. Hahaha… couldn’t help but to laugh when I saw him doing that… :P He really looked so serious!</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/01/86_eat_05.jpg" title="Say Grace before Eating" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/01/86_eat_05.jpg" alt="Say Grace before Eating" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Say Grace before Eating</p>
    
</div>

<p>Then, he ate. He ate SO well! Ha! I think I should do this more often!</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/01/86_eat_06.jpg" title="*Gobble*...." target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/01/86_eat_06.jpg" alt="*Gobble*...." /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">*Gobble*....</p>
    
</div>

<p>A few times, I caught him trying to feed Frosty, too… :P Usually after he asked Frosty, “Want…?” with a big smile. Hahaha.. I could see myself in the little guy when he tried to feed Frosty. He practically imitated how I usually feed him.</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/01/86_eat_07.jpg" title="Try Some, Frosty!" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/01/86_eat_07.jpg" alt="Try Some, Frosty!" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Try Some, Frosty!</p>
    
</div>

<p>The little guy looked a bit disappointed when Frosty didn’t eat… :P So, I had to open my mouth next to Frosty so that he could feed me instead. Hahaha… so glad that the little guy is no longer eating porridge. Can’t imagine if Frosty turns yellowish … or green … after this whole thing… :P</p>

<p>After a while, the little guy asked me for another chair. I thought, finally, a seat for me!</p>

<p>But, oops…. :P Nope, it wasn’t for me! Haha…</p>
