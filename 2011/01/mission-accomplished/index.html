        <p>You can call it a New Year Resolution. I’d rather consider it as one of the things in my bucket list, but I think that would make it sound too dramatic. So, I guess I’ll just stick to calling it: a mission. A wish.</p>

<p>Anyway, it’s a wish fulfilled, a mission accomplished… :) <em>_grinning from ear to ear_</em> I finally managed to sew some shirts for the little guy. From scratch!</p>

<p>I couldn’t really brag much about it actually. I didn’t really make the patterns from scratch. I just took one of the little guy’s shirt and roughly traced it to make the patterns. Piece of cake!</p>

<p>The more difficult part was, of course, in sewing them all together, especially the collar… &gt;_&lt; Thankfully, I’ve got my very own powerful wizard, aka my mom. Yup, it was not only Microsoft Excel that has its own powerful wizard, hee hee… ;) I could consult her whenever I wasn’t sure or when I was totally clueless. She could also help me distract the little guy whenever he tried to jump onto my lap to find out what kind of fun his mommy was having.</p>

<p>My favorite part? Personalizing the shirt… :) !</p>

<p>And when finally the shirt was done, the feeling was… downright ecstatic! Never mind if the sewing wasn’t really neat… the feeling was still wonderful!</p>

<p>Putting it on the little guy, I realized that its color and pattern make the shirt almost similar to the uniform for the kids in one of the play schools nearby. Hee hee… Oh well, it was the only fabric I had at home. So be it… our very own School of Fun’s uniform. Bet you couldn’t find it anywhere else. Ha! :P</p>

<p>The feeling was kinda addictive. I thought, hey.. this could probably be a once-in-a-blue-moon kind of thing. So, while the momentum was still there, off I went to the Chinatown to find nice fabric to make into another shirt for the little guy… :)</p>

<p>The red shirt at the back was the one I used to make the patterns. The yellow one is my favorite. That fabric was just too cute to miss! It’s just hard not to fall in love with the lines of colorful cars! No wonder the little guy kept asking for the fabric when I was busy sewing!</p>

<p>I know I should be grateful that it’s been raining almost every day lately… Otherwise, I might have gone for another retail therapy at Chinatown! :P</p>
