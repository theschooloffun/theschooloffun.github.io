<p>Yesterday, it was raining nearly the whole afternoon. Fortunately, we were at home… :) We certainly kept ourselves busy!</p>

<p><strong>Brush &amp; Strainer Painting</strong></p>

<p><strong>What we had</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>toothbrush</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>strainer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>paint</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>water (to dilute the paint)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>papers</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Let the Fun Begin!</strong></p>

<p>First, I mixed the paint with some water. That way, it was easier to ‘spray’ on using the strainer and the brush.</p>

<p>I’ve been faithfully keeping some old toothbrush. So, we’ve got one baby toothbrush and one adult toothbrush. That way, the little guy could use one, while I, too could play with the other one. Yet, if you think that the little guy would be contented with the baby toothbrush, ha! ha! He took over the adult toothbrush the moment he saw that it made a BIGGER splash on the paper… :P</p>

<p>More often than not, he took both brushes!</p>

<p>Anyway, nothing fancy here… All we had to do was just brush! :)</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Brush... brush...</p>
    
</div>

<p>Here’s what the little guy made:</p>

    The Litte Guy’s Work of Art</p>

<p>And here’s what I <em>_ahem_</em> managed to make whenever I could take one of the brushes from the little guy:</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Mommy's Work of Art</p>
    
</div>

<p>Still, the best work of art, I think, was actually found here:</p>

    <p class="image-caption">The Strainer's Work of Art</p>
    
</div>

<p>It was actually the leftover paint on the strainer after we used it! Don’t you think it looks like a globe with the continents? Hee hee… :P Or maybe my imagination was just running too wild.. :P</p>

<p><strong>We’ve Got Nuts!</strong></p>

<p><strong>What we had</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>nuts, of course! (we used pistachio nuts)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>muffin tin</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Let the Fun Begin!</strong></p>

<p>It was started with eating pistachio nuts… yum yum! Hee hee…</p>

<p>We gathered the shells and used them to play… ;)</p>

<p>First, we put them inside the muffin tin. The little guy happily moved them from one hole to another.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Nut-hopping</p>
    
</div>

<p>Then, we also lined up the shells. The little guy insisted on taking the picture himself for this one… :P That was why the picture was rather out of focus.</p>

<p>It went out pretty well at first.</p>

<p>Then, he started to throw them around and drove his mom crazy… :S</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Preparing for the nut rain</p>

<p>Okie… end of story! No more nuts to play with… :P</p>

<p><strong>Clothes Guessing</strong></p>

<p><strong>What we had</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>lots of clothes on a drying rack</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Let the Fun Begin!</strong></p>

<p>The rain really turned out to be a blessing in disguise, even though it meant that we had to dry our clothes inside… :)</p>

<p>The little guy had a great time pointing whose clothes, which clothes. He got better and better each time… :)</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Daddy's... this is daddy's... </p>
    
</div>

<p>Hehe… thankfully, the little guy’s grandparents’ clothes were there, too. Otherwise, it would just be: mommy’s, daddy’s… daddy’s, mommy’s… :P</p>

<p>There you go! See how busy we were when it was raining… :P</p>
