        <p>Don’t we just love long weekends! Especially a super long one!</p>

<p>To the little guy, long weekend means longer hours with his daddy at home. Of course, to me, that also translates to well shared workloads… :) That is why I quickly took the opportunity to do the messy activities that I had been wanted to do with the little guy, but too afraid to deal with the mess on my own.. :P Like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG48CbWNhCM">this one</a>!</p>

<p>One of the items found during spring cleaning was a brand new box of baking soda. As I have another box which is obviously used more often, that brand new box has been sitting in the kitchen for ages, but was only opened a few days ago… :P</p>

<p>Unfortunately (or should I say, thankfully), it was just a small box. So, I think we can forget about making a big volcano. We didn’t even bother to make it to look like a real volcano… ^_^” We just put some baking soda in small bowls and colored vinegar in some other small containers.</p>

<p>The little guy helped me to pour the vinegar into the bowls of baking soda. He seemed pretty impressed as he saw (and heard, too, I hope) it sizzled. He even asked for more vinegar… &gt;_&lt;</p>

<p>In case you were wondering why I chose such a dark color, well… it was because we didn’t want the output from our little science project get wasted. We wanted to give them a second lease on being useful as <a href="http://www.wholeliving.com/article/homemade-watercolor-paint">watercolor paint</a>… :)</p>

<p>We skipped the syrup, but we happily mixed in some cornstarch using skewers. As expected, the colors turned lighter. Still, they looked pretty nice. Then, my husband took one of the skewers and started drawing.</p>

<p>The little guy followed suit. He gave up after making a few lines, though. However, he took one of the containers and started stamping around.</p>

<p>With all the mess we had up to that point, it just felt right to do another messy activity… <em>_grinz_</em> I took another drawing paper, put on some glue and sprinkled some salt.</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/02/106_mess_05.jpg" title="Salty template" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/02/106_mess_05.jpg" alt="Salty template" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Salty template</p>
    
</div>

<p>I added a few drops of the watercolor paint to one end and a few more drops on another end. I was hoping that the salt would absorb the watercolor paint and that we could watch as the color travel along the path. Yet, it didn’t really work out as we expected. Not sure if it was because I didn’t put enough salt or I should have made the watercolor paint thinner. Anyway, our work of art looked more like a crime scene… :P</p>

<p>The earlier work of art, however, turned out nice. A beautiful mess, I’d say… :)</p>

<p>I love how adding the cornstarch makes it look like a chalk painting. And above all, I love how my husband turned the little guy’s container painting into cute rabbits, pig and chicken… :)</p>

<p>That certainly could only happen on a long weekend!</p>

<p>I wonder when we could have another long weekend this year… ^_^”</p>
