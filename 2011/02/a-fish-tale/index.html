        <p>After days of battling against the little guy’s flu bugs while nursing my own blocked nose, I could finally declare independence day. At least the little guy no longer had fever. Phewww… that means I could, hopefully, wave bye-bye to those tiring days when the little guy got frustrated for not being able to go out.</p>

<p>To celebrate, we decided to get hooked on fishing…. :)</p>

<p>That, of course, involved being outdoor and … water. I know, it might seem a tad too soon to get the little guy wet and all when he had just recovered from his flu. But, the weather was very hot this morning and the little guy just couldn’t wait any longer for something fun under the sun.</p>

<p>So, out we brought his bath tub and a pail of water.  I left it to the little guy to fill up our “fish tank”… :)</p>

<p>See that small strainer? You might want to remember that strainer… it was kinda important here… :P</p>

<p>Next, the school of fish! Yayyy… ^o^</p>

<p>I bought this cute ice cube tray from IKEA a while ago. I thought it would look nicer if I put some food coloring when I prepared the ice cubes. They did look nice, but I didn’t expect that the food coloring would dissolve in the water that fast… Or maybe it was just the hot weather…</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it seemed the heat couldn’t beat my little tornado… He managed to catch most of them using a strainer before the fish-shaped ice cubes melted and disappeared… :P</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Gotcha!</p>
    
</div>

<p>Boy… didn’t he have fun!</p>

<p>When there was no more fish to catch, he entertained himself making waves using the strainer. See, I told ya, the strainer was _really _important here…</p>

<p>He then decided to water my plants… &gt;<em>&lt; Yikes! Let’s just hope that my next harvest batch would not include purple ginger… ^</em>^”</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Purple.. purple... </p>

<p>We ended our activity by brushing the tub clean. Even if it does sound like fun, we just don’t want the little guy to turn purple, do we?! :P</p>
