        <p>It started off with an urge to do bubble painting with the little guy. You know, the one that requires placing a straw into the paint mixture and blowing until the bubbles fill up the container…</p>

<p>Knowing that in the little guy’s dictionary, straw = sucking, I decided to use a mix of food coloring and water instead.</p>

<p>Yet, in the end… I chickened out and took a safer, although not easier, route: blowing painting. Hee hee… :P</p>

<p><strong>What we had</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>food coloring (or paint)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>water</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>drawing paper</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>syringe  or pipette (to drop the paint onto the paper; you could also use your fingers)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Let the Fun Begin!</strong></p>

<p>After mixing food coloring and water, I let the little guy watch as I put a drop of the paint mixture onto the drawing paper. I showed him how the paint mixture would move as I blow (hard!).</p>

<p>No doubt he took over even before I completed my first sample… :P</p>

</div>

<p>Hahaha.. I know this huffing and puffing would straight away be a hit! Sometimes I helped him tilt the paper so that the paint could go faster.</p>

<p>After a while, the temptation to just use paint rather than food coloring was there… :P It was simply hard to resist, especially when I saw my husband’s art box lying around. I took the least used color (or so I thought, since it still looked full): dark grey.</p>

<p>You should have seen the little guy’s reaction when he saw how the colors mix! Priceless! He practically went, “Wooow…” every now and then! Or maybe it was just his way to steal a deep breath before huffing and puffing again… :P This was quite a tiring exercise, mind you.. :P</p>

<p>He also got more adventurous as I let him use the syringe.</p>

<p>Nope, he didn’t splatter the paint all over. Instead, he used the syringe as if it was a brush… :P That explains the Chinese painting style that we’ve got in the end… :)</p>
