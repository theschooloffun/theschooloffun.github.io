        <p>Looking back, I must say that baking and decorating cakes with my mom are always among the sweetest memories. So, when I managed to bake a cake in one hot afternoon, I decided to leave the decorating part to the guys in the family… :)</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/02/112_cake_01.jpg" title="All's yours, guys!" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/02/112_cake_01.jpg" alt="All's yours, guys!" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">All's yours, guys!</p>
    
</div>

<p>It really seemed like the best laid plan! Both my husband and the little guy soon got engrossed in putting up the chocolate flakes. One by one! Something that I’d usually just sprinkle within a minute or so gave them a few minutes worth of fun… :)</p>

    <a href="/uploads/2011/02/112_cake_02.jpg" title="One Here, One There" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/02/112_cake_02.jpg" alt="One Here, One There" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">One Here, One There</p>
    
</div>

<p>Of course, not all the chocolate flakes ended on the cake. Just see who was caught  in the camera!</p>

    <p class="image-caption">It somehow landed in my mouth, Mommy...</p>
    
</div>

<p>Lo and behold! The cake had now been decorated! Since we hadn’t quite celebrated PeeWee’s birthday two weeks ago, we partly dedicated the cake to him.</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/02/112_cake_04.jpg" title="Happy Super-belated Birthday, PeeWee!" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/02/112_cake_04.jpg" alt="Happy Super-belated Birthday, PeeWee!" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Happy Super-belated Birthday, PeeWee!</p>
    
</div>

<p>The little guy, however, must have thought that PeeWee was so touched that he could only sit there, stunned. He then made a wish on PeeWee’s behalf…</p>

    <a href="/uploads/2011/02/112_cake_05.jpg" title="Make a Wish!" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/02/112_cake_05.jpg" alt="Make a Wish!" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Make a Wish!</p>
    
</div>

<p>…and blew the candles for PeeWee!</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Puff!</p>
    
</div>

<p>Daddy was actually the one given the honor to do the cake-cutting. Yet again, the little guy thought he could do it better.</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/02/112_cake_07.jpg" title="A Bunch of Heart Cake Cutters..." target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/02/112_cake_07.jpg" alt="A Bunch of Heart Cake Cutters..." /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">A Bunch of Heart Cake Cutters...</p>
    
</div>

<p>As I went to the kitchen to get some forks, I couldn’t help but to admire the little guy’s confidence. He said, “yummy” even before he sank his teeth into the cake… :P</p>

<p>And when it was finally time to give the actual verdict about the cake, he couldn’t say anything. He took one big piece of cake and his mouth was simply … too full to say anything!</p>

    <p class="image-caption">A Cake Bigger than His Mouth</p>
    
</div>

<p>I wonder if his wish was actually to have the cake all for himself… :S</p>
