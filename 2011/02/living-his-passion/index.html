        <p>I used to think that the little guy had a very short attention span. Much shorter than his peers, and too short for me to keep him occupied in one activity for more than 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Until the day he found his passion.</p>

<p>He spent more than 15 minutes cutting strawberries. With full concentration. Into small pieces!</p>

<p>This wasn’t his first time using a knife. He had cut bananas many times since <a href="http://schooloffun.wordpress.com/2011/01/14/dont-do-this-at-home/">his first time</a>. Yet, this one seemed to keep him occupied for the longest time. Ever.</p>

<p>It could probably be more than 30 minutes, if only we had more strawberries to cut.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">More?</p>

<p>I still find it hard, though…</p>

<p>No, I don’t mind it’s hard to see that his attention span has grown.</p>

<p>It’s just hard to know that I would have to eat all that he has cut… :S You see, he doesn’t like to eat things that he has cut as much as he loves cutting them.</p>

<p>Uh oh…</p>

<p>Not another smashed strawberry! &gt;_&lt;</p>
