        <p>A couple of days ago, the weather seemed to turn warm. Uhm, okie… stop giving me that look… “hot” might be the more appropriate term.</p>

<p>I asked the little guy if he was interested to wash the shoes.</p>

<p>He didn’t reply. But, the sight of a pail full of water made his eyes grow round with excitement… :P</p>

<p>And so, we began our very important lesson in washing shoes.</p>

<p>First, we removed the shoelaces.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Pull here</p>
    
</div>

<p>It wasn’t that easy for his tiny fingers. He really had to struggle even to pull out from just one hole!</p>

<p>Next was the easiest and his most favorite part: brushing the shoes.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Brush! Brush!</p>
    
</div>

<p>After completing this part, I went in to get another pair of shoes to wash. Yet, when I saw what he did to that first pair of shoes, I changed my mind. I decided to just stop at one pair and left it to dry (after pouring the water out, of course!)</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Full to the brim</p>
    
</div>

<p>Guess what, it rained that afternoon and the following day! We had to wait a few days before the shoes were dry. I know, that tickled me to quote from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law">the Murphy’s Law</a>, too… :P</p>

<p>When the shoes were completely clean and dry, it was time for another lesson: putting on the shoelaces.</p>

<p>That proved to be very difficult for a 2-year-old. He persevered for just the first 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Then, he ran away with the clean, shiny shoes…:)</p>
