        <p>I used to just stock up on two types of food coloring: red and green. Yet, but as I idly browsed through the baking product aisle in the supermarket <em>_till now, I still haven’t figured out why I was there in the first place_</em>, I couldn’t help but to bring home blue and yellow. They were on sale!</p>

<p>I, however, still can’t see myself baking anything and coloring it with blue. Although blue is one of my favorite colors, I still find anything not naturally blue too bizarre to eat. Even when there are many kinds of food and beverages in different shades of blue nowadays.</p>

<p>Now that I have blue (plus, yellow!) food coloring at home… hm, maybe I should learn to like it. Or, at least, I should try with light blue first… :)</p>

<p>It’ll take some time… as for now, I shall just leave the food coloring to the little guy to play with.</p>

<p>Like what we did on this piece of kitchen towel…</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Little Blue Boy in Action</p>

<p>It did turn out pretty nice and I did want to keep it.</p>

<p>Too bad, the little guy got a little too excited and pour all what we had left in the palette into the tray <em>_I know.. luckily, we used a tray!_</em>.</p>

<p>The kitchen towel was soaking wet. Not in rainbow colors. It looked more like eerily black ink!</p>

<p>I was very worried that he would then try to empty the tray, spilling everything and staining things in our living room. So, I quickly got myself busy cleaning up… that’s why I didn’t bother to take any more pictures… :P</p>

<p>Luckily, except some fingers, nothing else was stained. We could keep the bleach back … :)</p>

<p>Oh well, I guess that was one downside to using food coloring for painting: It’s not really washable!</p>

<p>There… I did warn you… :P</p>
