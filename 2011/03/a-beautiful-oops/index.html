        <p>Ever since I let the little guy play with a spray bottle, it’s been one of his favorite bath toys. As I am currently letting the little guy experiment with different ways of painting, it just feels right to include that spray bottle … :)</p>

<p>And so I loaded the spray bottle. Not fully, though… just in case he decided to pour the whole thing out, instead of spraying. I used purple paint, thinned with water.</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/03/142_spray_02.jpg" title="Half-loaded..." target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/03/142_spray_02.jpg" alt="Half-loaded..." /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Half-loaded...</p>
    
</div>

<p>For an obvious reason, I chose to do this fun painting outside…&gt;:P I placed the paper on the staircase railings.</p>

<p>I pasted some leaves on the paper, hoping for some silhouettes to admire after we finished spraying… :)</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/03/142_spray_01.jpg" title="Ready to spray" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/03/142_spray_01.jpg" alt="Ready to spray" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Ready to spray</p>
    
</div>

<p>The little guy, too, was already in his “painting attire”, i.e. never-mind-if-it-gets-dirty-and-stained attire.</p>

<p>In short, we were ready to spray… <em>_grinz_</em></p>

<p>So, here comes the painter.</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/03/142_spray_03.jpg" title="Squirt... squirt..." target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/03/142_spray_03.jpg" alt="Squirt... squirt..." /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Squirt... squirt...</p>
    
</div>

<p>To my surprise, even though the spray left purple dots all over the little guy’s T-shirt, the patterns on the paper barely looked purple! &gt;_&lt;</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/03/142_spray_04.jpg" title="Plain Water?" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/03/142_spray_04.jpg" alt="Plain Water?" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Plain Water?</p>
    
</div>

<p>I guess I had used too much water to thin the paint. Oops… :(</p>

<p>But, of course, there are certainly no mistakes in art. There is just another opportunity to learn something new… ;)</p>

<p>Once the little guy was done spraying, I took down the paper and went to get some food coloring.</p>

<p>We dripped some food coloring onto the wet paper and watched in awe as the colors blended.</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/03/142_spray_05.jpg" title="The Real Work of Art" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/03/142_spray_05.jpg" alt="The Real Work of Art" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">The Real Work of Art</p>
    
</div>

<p>Then, I let the little guy use a skewer to mix colors and draw on the paper.</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/03/142_spray_06.jpg" title="Just Add a Skewer" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/03/142_spray_06.jpg" alt="Just Add a Skewer" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Just Add a Skewer</p>
    
</div>

<p>Very fun. And very messy… :P</p>

<p>Good thing we did this outside!</p>

<p>In the end, the paper was too wet to keep. So, the picture above was the only thing we have to remind us about this fun experiment.</p>

<p>The little guy, however, had somehow grown a mustache during the process… :P</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/03/142_spray_07.jpg" title="The Blue Moustache" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/03/142_spray_07.jpg" alt="The Blue Moustache" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">The Blue Moustache</p>
    
</div>

<p>It disappeared after he took a bath a few hours later. Yet, before that,  he certainly had a great laugh looking at himself in the mirror.</p>
