        <p>If you happen to have a kid of your own, do you often feel that sometimes you simply forget how much your kid has grown up?</p>

<p>I do.</p>

<p>The little guy is growing, at full speed… and I often think that he is <em>still</em> a small baby! As light as a small rice sack. And much shorter than our dining table.</p>

<p>And oh yeah, that latter assumption often gives me mess to clean up… :p</p>

<p>So, here’s a note to myself: Never ever leave a bottle of milk and a glass on the table for more than 5 minutes. The little guy can easily reach whatever that is on the table now (even if you think it is far from the edge!) and you never know what could happen!</p>

<p>Like the other day when the little guy rushed to find me in my room, saying, “wet… wet…”</p>

<p>The first thing that crossed my mind was … uhm, a wee wee accident. So, when I found him clean and dry with no sign of a wee wee accident, I felt relieved. But when he kept pulling me and saying, “wet…wet…”, I had no choice but to follow him to show me what actually happened.</p>

<p>And here is what he showed me.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">My glass is overflowing...</p>
    
</div>

<p>Obviously, the little guy had poured the whole bottle of milk into his glass. Thankfully, there was just that much of milk left in the bottle to fill up the glass… ^_^” He didn’t bother to ask and wait for me to fill up his glass anymore! A good sign of independence… yet, it could also mean a major disaster if the bottle was full… :P</p>

<p>Anyway, the little guy then asked me to let him sit on the chair so that he could practice his drinking-without-holding-the-glass skill… :P</p>

<p>Of course, nobody got to cry over the spilled milk… ;) But somebody did have to clean up the mess… :P</p>

<p>Good thing he helped me with the first stage of cleaning up… :)</p>
