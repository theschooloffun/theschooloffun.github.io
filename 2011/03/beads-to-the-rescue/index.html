        <p>Today was just one of those tough days. We all have been in this kind of days, haven’t we? &gt;_&lt;</p>

<p>It was just one of those days when the little guy only seems to have the word “No!” in his dictionary. Since very early in the morning… &gt;_&lt;</p>

<p>It was one of those days when he constantly throws a fit. For even the simplest reason. Like when he couldn’t find his favorite milk, with the right flavor and the right size, i.e. the big bottle of chocolate milk. Obviously, the small bottle of strawberry milk in the fridge couldn’t appease him at all.</p>

<p>It was one of those days when I then had to bring him to the supermarket to get that certain bottle of milk… only to find that he had something against sitting down on the pram. And nope, he didn’t want to walk either. Trust me, it certainly feels silly to push an empty pram with a wiggling toddler in my arms.</p>

<p>It was also one of those days when people at the supermarket stared at this helpless mother as she tried to persuade this one little tornado to join the queue at the cashier. Yup, obviously, holding a box of his favorite cereal gave him the energy to run (forget about walking!) around.</p>

<p>It was also one of those days he could bring a whole big mess to my kitchen within less than a minute. First, it was a whole rice mess. The rice kept falling onto the floor as he played with the box of rice. And later on, after I managed to clean it, he flooded the kitchen with the water that I prepared for mopping the floor.</p>

<p>Just perfect.</p>

<p>And all those happened even before I had the chance to have breakfast. Yeah… a hungry mommy is usually an impatient mommy. So, the time out corner seemed to be on high demand today.</p>

<p>And all those happened while the news on TV was blaring about the blast at the nuclear plant in Japan, spelling the big letter W-O-R-R-Y in my head. I know, I know… I shouldn’t have turned on the TV…:S</p>

<p>So, I thought maybe we both just needed to chill a little bit.</p>

<p>Threading beads seems to be pretty relaxing… :) So, I put up one long wire, from the doorknob to the door stopper. We threaded together some beads onto the wire… and, we’ve got ourselves a relaxing entertainment that could be brought up…</p>

<p>We certainly had fun then!</p>

<p>But, if you ask me whether this story then ended with a happily ever after, well… in what seemed to be the finale (or so I hope), he spilled his chocolate milk on the bed sheet (just right after I managed to get one load of laundry done!) in his attempt to show me that he could drink from a glass while he was lying down! &gt;_&lt;</p>

<p>Still half a day to go… but I am crossing my fingers that he would somehow be back to his good old self again after his nap. ^_^</p>
