        <p>The little guy accidentally spilled some of the bubble solution that I made for him (basically just a mixture of dish-washing liquid and water).</p>

<p>I could tell that he felt really bad about it. He went around to look for the mop to clean the mess he made. The mop, however, was not in the usual place.</p>

<p>I showed him a brush, asking him if he wanted to use that instead… :P</p>

<p>To my surprise, he agreed!</p>

<p>Obviously, he enjoyed this new tool… :P You see, I don’t usually let him play with the brush. He must be overjoyed when I actually offered him that brush… hee hee..  Oh well, it has been a while since I last gave the floor a good scrub anyway…<em>_grinz_</em> So, I let him enjoy brushing for a good 5 minutes or so.</p>

<p>I also introduced him to the squeegee… It became his favorite in no time.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Squeegee Attack!</p>
    
</div>

<p>It was, of course, a bad decision from my side.</p>

<p>A. Very. Bad. Decision.</p>

<p>Now, whenever he sees that squeegee, he would keep asking me if he could play with it… &gt;_&lt;</p>

<p>Uh oh…!</p>
