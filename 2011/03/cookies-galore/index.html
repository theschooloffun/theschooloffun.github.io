<p><em>Oh… you do have something yummy there? Okie… go on then!</em></p>

<p>Last Sunday, my husband, the little guy and I had quite a lazy hazy afternoon. All three of us were down with either mild diarrhea or blocked nose. Hence, we stayed at home.</p>

<p>Then, my husband asked that question, “What do you think we should do?”</p>

<p>And so the quest to ransack the kitchen began. It wasn’t long, though. I knew exactly what we all could do… <em>_grinz_</em>: bake cookies!</p>

<p>The first assignment was to prepare the chocolate chips. I only had one big block of dark chocolate at home. So, my husband helped to cut it into small pieces, while the little guy helped him put the pieces into a container… :)</p>

<p>Sounds like a great teamwork, eh?! ;)</p>

<p>Uhm, well… that was just like… theoretically speaking. They were supposed to do just that… But, judging from the amount of chocolate chips that went into the container vs. how big the chocolate block previously was, I suspect the teamwork went beyond that!</p>

<p>Somebody had been eating my chocolate while I got busy preparing the cookie dough!!!</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Tried and Tested</p>
    
</div>

<p>Anyway, we were soon ready to move to the next assignment. So, this time round, my husband was to shape the cookie dough and place them on the baking tray, while the little guy took the duty of “sprinkling” the chocolate chips.</p>

<p>Look how generous he was!</p>

<p>But, that was it… After the first 2 batches, only my first assistant remained. The little one… uhm, went about his business… :P</p>

<p>He certainly did not know what he had missed! While he was busy with his trains and cars, I went from “whooo” to “wheee…” seeing my cookies in the oven.</p>

<p>And when we were done… Cookies!!!</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Glorious Cookies!</p>

<p>The whole family turned into some sort of cookie monsters… :P ﻿﻿</p>

<p>Even the little guy thinks one should always have one for each hand!</p>

<p>What a Sunday! By the time the cookies were ready, we no longer had diarrhea… no more blocked nose either.</p>

<p>Just cookies.</p>

<p>And a little more cookies…</p>

<p>Uh oh, wait… who took my cookies?!</p>
