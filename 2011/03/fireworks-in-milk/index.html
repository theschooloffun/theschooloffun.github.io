        <p>What do you do when you have some extra not-so-fresh milk? Search the internet and find <a href="http://www.stevespanglerscience.com/experiment/00000066">something fun to do with it</a>, of course!</p>

<p>First, we prepared the milk. The little guy currently loves squeezing  and squirting. It was kinda hard to tell him not to finish the milk in  one go. Yet, somehow, we managed to do this experiment in three batches.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Squirt... squirt...</p>
    
</div>

<p>I was in charge of the color, simply because I did not want him to pour the whole bottles of food coloring… :P</p>

<p>We had a great time guessing what the drops of color looked like. Or  rather, I guessed. He giggled. I missed to take a picture of the  first batch. But you could see the other two and make your own  guesses… :)</p>

<p>The  moment I handed the little guy the soapy cotton bud, I got a bit wary.  Give him anything liquid and a stick and he would be happy to make  waves for you… :P So, at first, I held his hand and guided him to slowly place the cotton bud in the milk. And…</p>

    <a href="/uploads/2011/03/127_milk_04.jpg" title="Whee... fireworks!" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/03/127_milk_04.jpg" alt="Whee... fireworks!" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Whee... fireworks!</p>
    
</div>

<p>The burst of color really reminded me of fireworks! It may not be that clear in the picture above. The picture was taken in a hurry. I was a bit worried that the little guy might flick some water on the lens.</p>

<p>I guess you just have to try and see it for yourself! ;)</p>

<p>Anyway, after 3 batches, the little guy kinda got the hang of it. He seemed to suspect that it was all thanks to the soap. So, he began his own experiment. With no patience, obviously… for he squirted the whole bottle of soap!</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Maybe there'll be a bigger firework...</p>
    
</div>

<p>And so… we had a plate full of milk and soap. Before he finished my whole bottle of soap, I quickly went to get a straw, placed it into the mixture and blew bubbles… :) For a while, the little guy found it more fun to pop the bubbles… :P He totally forgot about the bottle of soap.</p>

    <a href="/uploads/2011/03/127_milk_06.jpg" title="Pop! Pop!" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/03/127_milk_06.jpg" alt="Pop! Pop!" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Pop! Pop!</p>
    
</div>

<p>Did the little guy then ask to try blowing bubbles with the straw, too? You bet! The next mission impossible involved trying to tell him that he just wasn’t ready for it yet. He insisted, though. A few times, he would probably have sucked in some if only I didn’t pinch the straw in time!</p>

<p>So, to distract him, I went to take some pieces of paper (after hiding the straw, of course!).</p>

<p>And look at what we made… <em>_grinz_</em></p>

</div>

<p>Nice effect, don’t you think? It really reminds me of my biology class… :)</p>

<p>We made four cards in total… :) We nearly made five… but the little guy successfully drown the fifth one when I went to get a piece of tissue… &gt;_&lt;</p>

<p>That’s alright… At least he forgot about the straw… :P</p>
