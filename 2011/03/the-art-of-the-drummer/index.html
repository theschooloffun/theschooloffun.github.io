<p>But if I tell you how this was made, you might be able to better appreciate it . Let me give it a try… ;)</p>

<p>It was just another cloudy afternoon. The little guy was still one grouchy toddler. In this week’s chart, the meltdowns’ frequency and intensity were still somewhere up there.</p>

<p>During this kind of episodes, art-making seems to be the only hope whenever I’m at my wits’ end. It never fails to keep him occupied. And best of all, it keeps both of us happy (and keep my sanity intact after handling all the meltdowns!). Even if it is only in mere minutes.</p>

<p>So, yup… if you notice that we’ve been making lots of artworks lately, it really has nothing to do with the school holiday. The little guy hasn’t gone to any real school, in fact… :P</p>

<p>Anyway, I realized that we often paint on the floor or on the table. The little guy had never experienced painting with an art easel.</p>

<p>Uhm, neither had I, actually… :P</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we don’t have an art easel at home. We don’t intend to buy one either. So, we made full use of our front gate and designed our own art easel.</p>

<p>And look who was enjoying the custom-built easel… :P</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Vertically Fun!</p>
    
</div>

<p>The little guy then experimented another way of painting by using his toes to hold the brush. Too bad I didn’t get the chance to take a picture of his stunt… :P</p>

<p>He also took my brush and tried painting with two brushes…</p>

<p>… before he finally figured it out by himself that music + art = fun! He took the brushes as drum sticks and started singing and “beating” his painting, taking breaks to dip the brushes into the paint every now and then.</p>

<p>It was just hilarious! So glad that I videotaped the whole singing session! Ha! ;)</p>

<p>And yup… that’s the interesting story behind that dull painting… :)</p>
