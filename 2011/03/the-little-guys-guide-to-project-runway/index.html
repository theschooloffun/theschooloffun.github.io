        <p>The little guy still loves it when I paint his hands and feet. So, one afternoon, when he was fast asleep, I got the ‘runway’ ready… ;)</p>

<p>You could see that I had foreseen the mess. I prepared a bowl of water on one side and a pack of wet tissue on the other side. Somehow, the picture of an active toddler with hands and feet full of paint got me a bit worried… :P</p>

<p>After the little guy woke up from his beauty nap, we got ourselves busy painting and jumping around at the same time. Yes, I really mean “we”! I decided to paint my toes and joined the fun… :)</p>

<p>I only left him on his own when he started crawling around. While he was busy on his own, I went to prepare his “pot of gold”: a bowl of green bean soup… :)</p>

<p>The moment I put the bowl down was exactly the moment the little guy left the runway to snatch his pot of gold. It was quite a struggle to persuade him to wash his hands and feet first!</p>

<p>He continued with his project runway after he finished his snack.</p>

<p>We then left our project runway to dry overnight and took a picture of it the following morning.</p>
