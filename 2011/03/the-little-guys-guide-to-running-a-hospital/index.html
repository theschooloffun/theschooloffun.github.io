        <p>Certainly, spending time with a busy toddler is never an easy task for those who are sensitive to noise.</p>

<p>No, I’m not one of them. I must admit, though, when he first started pushing the towel rack around the house, I winced at the sound it made. I nearly shouted at him, pleading him to stop that irritating sound.</p>

<p>Yet, after seeing the little guy pushing my towel rack around with  his beloved dinosaur on top, I decided to run a hospital with him instead… :)</p>

<p>Our story began with Dino coming in from the Accident &amp; Emergency department. We tried to tickle him, but he didn’t respond… so, we declared that he had suffered a loss of consciousness…:P</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">

<p>The little guy, M.D. then decided to wrap a bandage around the head and place adhesive bandages near his nose. Uh oh… I hope they didn’t block Dino’s nose… &gt;_&lt;</p>

<p>Don’t look at me, it was the doctor’s idea. I was too busy with the camera to show him what to do… :P Besides, I didn’t want to spoil the fun… :)</p>

<p>I must claim, however, that our hospital delivers first-class services. Just see what the little guy did next.</p>

</div>

<p>He kissed Dino and wished him to get well soon! Awww… so sweet of him!</p>

<p>Anyway, it was quite a busy day at the hospital. So, the little guy couldn’t really spend much time with Dino. He then dashed to see his other patient, Duckie.</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/03/145_hospital_04.jpg" title="A Jab for Duckie" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/03/145_hospital_04.jpg" alt="A Jab for Duckie" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">A Jab for Duckie</p>
    
</div>

<p>I wasn’t sure what happened to Duckie, but the little guy decided to just give him a jab and moved him to another ward (i.e. on the table… no more comfy bed for you, Duckie!).</p>

<p>Or, perhaps, the little guy just thought that Duckie’s case wasn’t that exciting. Plus, we needed a place for our next patient: Whalee.</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/03/145_hospital_05.jpg" title="Coming in...!" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/03/145_hospital_05.jpg" alt="Coming in...!" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Coming in...!</p>
    
</div>

<p>I wondered what happened to Whalee… It was just getting more exciting!</p>

<p>In the end, I couldn’t resist to stop taking pictures and just join the fun… &gt;:P We handled quite a number of patients that day!</p>

<p>And hey, do you know something, the sound didn’t bother me anymore! ;)</p>
