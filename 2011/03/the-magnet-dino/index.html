<p>I find the colors just perfect to make some dinosaurs… :) All I had to do was draw some dinosaurs.</p>

<p>After cutting, however, I realized that they still looked rather … empty. The little guy came to the rescue when he took his colored pencils and shouted “Color!”</p>

<p>He might be the one suggesting to color… but he was the first to leave me all by myself, with that colored pencil in less than 5 minutes! Geee… :S</p>

<p>I know, it wasn’t easy to color such small dinosaurs. It would have been easier had we colored them first (before cutting).</p>

<p>Anyway, after leaving those dinosaurs on the table for a couple of days and persuading the little guy to color every now and then using either colored pencil or oil pastel, we (finally) managed to get them done. Guess who colored the most? Ha! :P</p>

<p>You could now find them on our fridge’s door, thanks to the magnet that I put at the back of each dino. Well, at least you could find them there… most of the time.</p>

<p>Sometimes, if you don’t find them there… you just need to look around a bit. They might just be busy trying to climb out from the rice box.</p>

<p>Hee hee… perhaps if dinosaurs were to live to this age, this kind of thing done by the little guy would make them extinct sooner or later… :P</p>

<p>Truly an example of survival of the fittest… :P</p>
