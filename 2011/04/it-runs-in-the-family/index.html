        <p>There has been this famous story about how my husband, when he was much younger, could spend hours <em>_I am not sure if it was literally “hours”_</em> playing with his marble run.</p>

<p>So, I thought, hey, if that marble run could be so fascinating to my husband, wouldn’t the same apply to the little guy? Hee hee… in my mind, I could already picture that quiet, peaceful time I could have while the little guy plays on his own…&gt;:p</p>

<p>Days went by as I tried to figure out how to build a marble run. I thought of using kitchen towel rolls, but I wasn’t sure if those rolls, glued on a cardboard with normal glue, could withstand the little guy’s strength.</p>

<p>Then, I saw <a href="http://twochicksandahen.blogspot.com/2011/03/toilet-paper-tube-marble-run.html">this post</a>. So glad to know that it really is possible to build a marble run using those rolls… :)</p>

<p>And guess what glue she used?! Glue gun!!! Yayyy… that solved my problem… :)</p>

<p>Uhm, partially…</p>

<p>You see, we do have a glue gun, but I just don’t quite like the smell.</p>

<p>It wasn’t that difficult to solve that part of the problem, though… :) With a little nudge here and there, my husband agreed to build the marble run for us. Yipeee… ^o^</p>

<p>Anyway, it wasn’t that difficult to make. Or, maybe I should say, it didn’t seem that difficult to make… :P</p>

<p>The following day, the marble run was ready for the little guy to destr… err, I mean, to use.</p>

<p>We don’t have marbles at home. So, we use wooden beads and metal bells<br />
that we used for threading games <a href="http://schooloffun.wordpress.com/2011/03/17/for-whom-the-bells-toll/">before</a>. I think they make nicer sounds!</p>

<p>Anyway, that thing about being fascinated by the marble run, I guess it really runs in the family! Although the little guy doesn’t really spend hours each time, he really had a blast!</p>

<p>It’s amazing how such a simple game could make this kind of priceless expression…</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Priceless...</p>

<p>Since then, he had proceeded to try out putting the beads at different points (e.g. at level 2, 3, and so on). He had also tried putting his cars and trains there, hoping that they, too, would roll down… :S</p>

<p>And oh, does the marble run last, you ask?</p>

<p>Sadly, a few days later, the little guy decided to peel off one of the side rolls… &gt;_&lt; Geee! Seriously, if there is any manufacturing company out there that looks for anyone to help them test whether a product is sturdy enough, the little guy would be the right candidate!</p>

<p>But, no worries, daddy and his glue gun would fix it… ;)</p>

<p>Right, daddy? <em>_wink, wink_</em> It would be even better if you could turn it to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_CDLBTJD4M">this</a>….:P</p>
