        <p>Picture this, and tell me who wouldn’t like this.</p>

<p>One early morning, and you find that your little ones already know what they want to do for the day and they are determined to do it straight away. Yup, even when they are still in their PJs.</p>

<p>I know… what a joy! At least, you know you don’t need to pull your hair finding things to keep your toddlers positively busy.</p>

<p>That was exactly how I felt that morning when the little guy pointed at the pots of paint after he got up from his bed.</p>

<p>Slowly, he painted. Probably with his eyes half closed, too…</p>

<p>He got more excited with each stroke.</p>

<p>He was happy. So was I.</p>

<p>It seemed to be such a perfect way to start a peaceful day…</p>

<p>That was until the little guy decided to be a little bit more creative… ^_^”</p>

<p>He must have thought that his feet needed some morning exercise… &gt;_&lt;</p>

    Ready to Leave Colorful Tracks</p>

<p>He must have thought that his mommy needed some exercise too, i.e. by mopping the floor for the second time that morning… :P</p>

<p>Yeah, right… the perfect way to start a peaceful day!</p>

<p>Love it!</p>
