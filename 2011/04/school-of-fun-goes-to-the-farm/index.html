        <p>One of the good things about getting involved in social activities - like in our case, with the choir group - is that, once in a while, we get to avoid from becoming a lazy bum on a Saturday.</p>

<p>So, this morning, though the comfortable bed tempted us to just continue sleeping, we pulled ourselves out of the bed. Surprisingly, it wasn’t that difficult to wake the little guy up either. He must have sensed the exciting outing we were about to have!</p>

<p>It was sunny when we reached <a href="http://www.bollywoodveggies.com/">Bollywood Veggies Farm</a> at about 930 AM. Still, the hot scorching sun did not deter us from entering further.</p>

<p>The little guy got really excited seeing such huge space for him to run around and explore. Ah… there you go, another good thing about going there in a group: mommy and daddy got to rest, while someone else watched over the very active little guy… :P</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Victim no. 1</p>

<p>In short, the little guy really got to channel his rambunctious energy there…</p>

<p>Just forget about getting him to learn anything about vegetables or plants. I only managed to get his attention when it came to showing him wild creatures that he doesn’t get to see everyday.</p>

<p>Like this lizard…</p>

<p>… and this snail.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Run, Snail, Run!</p>

<p>The only plant that managed to catch his attention was the mimosa, the one with the leaves that quickly close when touched.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Touch and Close</p>
    
</div>

<p>But then again, this plant wasn’t something new to him. We often saw and “played” with this plant near where we stay back <a href="http://schooloffun.wordpress.com/2010/10/31/at-home-with-bob-the-builders-team/">when the bob the builder’s team hasn’t taken away our precious field</a>… :’(</p>

<p>He also loved playing with the drops of water on the leaves after the heavy rain, but of course… there was no further attempt to learn anything else about the plants… :P</p>

<p>We also visited <a href="http://www.haydairies.com.sg/">Hay Dairies Goat Farm</a> later in the afternoon, giving the little guy his first introduction to the animals called goats. Obviously, the little guy isn’t as lucky as me who got to see goats nearly every day when I was his age. Back then, lines of goats paraded down the road in front of my house nearly every day. Although I am pretty sure I wouldn’t find it amusing now, it was such an entertainment back then… :P</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Baa, Baa, Brown Goats</p>
    
</div>

<p>And how did the little guy handle the first introduction to goats? Well, since the goats were pretty far away from him, he didn’t get scared nor excited. He just happily sang “Baa, Baa, Black Sheep”.</p>

<p>Uh oh… I think I have to fix this misconception soon! :P</p>

<p>Speaking about misconception, hey… I have just got to learn that one way to differentiate between a sheep and a goat, other than by the wool, is <a href="http://www.sheep101.info/sheepandgoats.html">by looking at the tail</a>… :)</p>

<p>So, at the end of the trip to the farms:</p>

<p>learning about farm animals - checked<br />
learning about snails, lizards, ants, caterpillars, butterflies, etc. - checked<br />
learning about mimosa - checked<br />
learning about fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices plants - ….<em>_oops_</em></p>

<p>Don’t worry… there would certainly be another visit next time… ;)</p>

<p>And, oh by the way, one more thing:</p>

<p>feeding the mosquitoes - checked checked checked</p>
