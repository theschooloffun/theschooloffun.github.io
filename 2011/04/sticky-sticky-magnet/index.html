        <p>The latest series in our various activities to explore different ways of painting involved some paper clips and fridge magnets.</p>

<p>This activity didn’t take long to win his heart. In fact, this seemed to be another favorite of his… :)</p>

<p><strong>What we had</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>paint</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>paper clips (we used 2, but you could certainly use as many as you like!)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>fridge magnets (or any other strong magnets)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>drawing paper</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>chairs (or table)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>clear tapes</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Let the Fun Begin!</strong></p>

<p>I first arranged the two chairs: next to each other, but not too close to each other. The two chairs would serve as a kind of platform for the drawing paper. Then, using clear tapes, I sealed the drawing paper across the two chairs.</p>

<p>As you could see from the picture above, I placed the paper clips on top of the paper. We would be using the fridge magnets to move these paper clips from underneath the paper… :)</p>

<p>After putting some paint, of course.</p>

<p>As we continued moving the paper clips using the fridge magnets, our artwork slowly appeared. Whohoo…</p>

<p>It was really fun! Apart from the tiny splatters from the moving paper clips, this was also not as messy as I thought it would be. Since the little guy was only moving one fridge magnet underneath, his fingers were relatively clean! :p</p>

<p>When I thought the little guy had lost interest to continue, I taught him how to peel off the clear tapes so that I could leave the painting outside to dry. He seemed to enjoy peeling off the clear tapes, so I left him on his own to keep the paper clips away.</p>

<p>When I came back, I found him adding some colors to the drawing paper. Not with paper clips, of course. He had somehow invented another way of painting… :P He made a large ball of crumpled clear tapes, dipped it into paint <em>_yeah, he opened the bottle himself.. &gt;_&lt;_</em> and started stamping.</p>

<p>So, once again, the little guy was busy painting. After a while, he asked for the paper clips again.</p>

<p>Hehehe, not bad… since this whole painting activity kept him occupied, we had quite a peaceful morning.</p>

<p>I also love the artwork that we’ve got at the end… :)</p>

<p>I could easily tell that the little guy also loves this painting method. Later that day, after his nap, he pulled out and arranged the chairs, just like how I arranged the chairs that morning.</p>

<p>He then gave me his widest smile and said, “color…?”</p>

<p>Yeah… a signal that he wanted to do it again… :P</p>

<p>I let him use finger paint this time round.</p>

<p>It was stickier and rather “heavy” to move around, though.</p>

<p>So, after a while, the little guy decided to re-purpose the fridge magnet… :P</p>

<p>He placed the fridge magnet on the paper and started moving it around, just like a sponge…. hee hee…</p>

<p>Now, that was messy! :P</p>
