        <p>I’ve finally figured out what to do with <a href="http://schooloffun.wordpress.com/2011/03/17/the-art-of-the-drummer/">one of the little guy’s masterpieces</a>… :)</p>

<p>So, before it got accidentally thrown, I quickly went to find the picture of dinosaur that my husband drew for us months ago. Using that picture as a pattern, we soon had two dinosaurs ready to be cut… :)</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Ready to Cut</p>
    
</div>

<p>I did think of making more dinosaurs. Too bad the little guy took over the black marker and drew on the paper while I was busy cutting… &gt;_&lt; Unless we don’t mind to have black dinosaurs, I guess we just had to accept this kind of cause for the extinction of the dinosaurs… :P Two dinosaurs are good enough.</p>

<p>After I finished cutting the dinosaurs, the little guy decided to run a puppet show.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">The Talking Dinos</p>
    
</div>

<p>He seemed to enjoy his own show so much that I didn’t have the heart to continue with my plan. Obviously, he didn’t know that his two dinosaurs would soon be glued into one… &gt;:P</p>

<p>I waited until he left the two dinosaurs alone before I glued the two dinosaurs on the cardboard that I had prepared.</p>

<p>And, finally… :)</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/04/163_dino_03.jpg" title="The One and Only of Its Kind" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/04/163_dino_03.jpg" alt="The One and Only of Its Kind" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">The One and Only of Its Kind</p>
    
</div>

<p>There are actually two holes on the middle part of the cardboard. Those are meant for us to put our fingers in.</p>

<p>Here, let the little guy show you…</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/04/163_dino_04.jpg" title="Ready for the Walking Dino?" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/04/163_dino_04.jpg" alt="Ready for the Walking Dino?" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Ready for the Walking Dino?</p>
    
</div>

<p>We can then just wiggle our fingers inside, rocking the dinosaurs back and forth, so that it would look as if the dinosaur is walking.</p>

<p>But, of course, the little guy thought walking was not fun for the dinosaur at all.</p>

<p>Flying was much more fun!</p>
