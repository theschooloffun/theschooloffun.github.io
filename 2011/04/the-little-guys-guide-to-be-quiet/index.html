        <p>I recently decided to make a cloth book for the little guy.</p>

<p>I desperately need something to keep the little guy occupied whenever we are at the church. Something that doesn’t make much noise, of course… You see, cars usually work well… until he starts banging or crashing the cars… &gt;_&lt;</p>

<p>So, when I finally managed to complete this cloth book project, I got very excited. It was really hard for me to wait and keep quiet about it until Sunday came… :P</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/04/165_book_01.jpg" title="The Crumpled Cloth Book" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/04/165_book_01.jpg" alt="The Crumpled Cloth Book" /></a>

<p>I finally let him play with it on a Friday. It surely got his attention! You could surely tell how much that cloth book has endured by looking at how crumpled it is in the above picture… :P So glad it is made of cotton fabric, not paper! Otherwise, I could just forget about bringing it along on that Sunday… hee hee.</p>

<p>The first page comes with a kind of flower. The petals are colorful felt fabrics, with snap on buttons to open and close the petals. This usually keeps the little guy occupied for about a minute or two. Sometimes, he just doesn’t have the patience to carefully place the buttons. Then he would take longer time to close all the petals… :)</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/04/165_book_02.jpg" title="One Flower" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/04/165_book_02.jpg" alt="One Flower" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">One Flower</p>
    
</div>

<p>The second page is very easy: building two ice cream cones. All the little guy needs to do is just placing the ice cream on top of the cones, and the ice cream cones are ready to be served. Too easy!</p>

</div>

<p>The third page is even easier: traffic light. Well, that is, as long as he gets the sequence of the light correctly… :)</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/04/165_book_04.jpg" title="Three Lights" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/04/165_book_04.jpg" alt="Three Lights" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Three Lights</p>
    
</div>

<p>The fourth page is, of course, his favorite. It has 4 cars lined on 4 threads. He can slide the cars left and right. He could easily spend the longest time in this page.</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/04/165_book_05.jpg" title="Four Cars" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/04/165_book_05.jpg" alt="Four Cars" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Four Cars</p>
    
</div>

<p>So, how did this cloth book score as a quiet hours toy?</p>

<p>The good news is … the time he spends on it each time is almost as long as the time needed to make this cloth book. During that period, though not as quiet as a mouse, he would be such a wonderful boy at the church.</p>

<p>The not-so-good-news is … it didn’t take me long to make this book… &gt;_&lt;</p>

<p>Oh well, at least, the little guy still gets excited whenever I take this book out. Now if I could just figure out how to hide this book on other days so that it would still be exciting to him every Sunday… :)</p>
