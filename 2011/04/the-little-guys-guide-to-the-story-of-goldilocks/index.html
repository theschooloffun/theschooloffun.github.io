        <p>This is the story of Goldilocks.</p>

<p>Duh… what am I saying?! Of course this is not the story of Goldilocks. This is the story of the little guy re-enacting the story of Goldilocks and the three bears… :)</p>

<p>One day, the little guy came upon a house. The three bears, Papa Bear (aka Frosty Bear), Mama Bear (aka PeeWee Bear) and Baby Bear lived in this house. That morning, they were having their snack time.</p>

<p>Being polite, the little guy knocked and walked right in. He was certainly no Goldilocks who came in when no one was around.</p>

</div>

<p>Now, you see, Papa Bear was such a big bear, so he sat on a big chair. The second chair, which belonged to Mama Bear, was slightly smaller, but more comfortable. The biggest chair, however, had to be Baby Bear’s. Otherwise, it would be kinda difficult for Baby Bear to reach the table… :P</p>

<p>Ah wait, let me put all the three bears to one side so that you could see the three chairs… :)</p>

</div>

<p>The little guy didn’t try all the chairs like Goldilocks. He straight away knew which chair to choose: the biggest and most colorful one! Hee heee…</p>

<p>Anyway, after learning about big-medium-small, we came to the part where Gold… oops… I mean, the little guy, would have to “try” the snack… with the bears’ permissions, of course.</p>

<p>Papa Bear loves anything hot. He had a big glass of hot water. Not too hot, of course… we certainly didn’t want anyone to get burnt, did we? :)</p>

<p>The little guy then dipped his right hand into the big glass.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">It's Hot, Papa Bear!</p>

<p>Mama Bear likes anything cold. She had a medium sized glass of iced water. With lots of ice cubes for the little guy to play…</p>

    <p class="image-caption">It's Cold, Mama Bear!</p>
    
</div>

<p>Baby Bear had the smallest glass, with room temperature water. But by the time it was his turn, the little guy had pulled all the other two glasses and lined them in front of him. The little guy happily dipped his right hand into all the glasses, one after the other.</p>

<p>And the story ended with puddles of water for mommy to clean… ^_^”</p>

<p>No, the little guy didn’t need to run way into the forest. The three bears didn’t chase him out. They went to take a nap with him instead… :)</p>

<p>What a story!</p>
