        <p>Early this year, the little guy started to love lining his cars like a long train.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, without me realizing it, this little guy, who used to only like cars and trucks, has added trains to his favorite toys.</p>

<p>We don’t really have many trains at home. So, yup, go figure… the little guy just <em>has</em> to improvise.</p>

<p>Then, I had this beautiful plan of making a train out of toilet paper rolls. Not just an immobile train. I want to make one with wheels that could go round and round… :P</p>

<p>I searched online and found this cool <a href="http://www.looledo.com/index.php/oatmeal-express.html">oatmeal express</a>. Impressive, but I think I’ll go for something simpler.</p>

<p>So, I thought I would just modify <a href="http://www.looledo.com/index.php/simple-tp-dozer.html">this Simple TP Dozer instruction</a> to make a train.</p>

<p>At first, I was really excited! That time, the little guy was also on a painting spree. So, getting him to paint the toilet paper rolls wasn’t a problem… :)</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Purple</p>
    
</div>

<p>In fact, within that same day itself, we managed to paint 5 carriages for the train. Sweet!</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Ready to Roll!</p>

<p>Lots of mess to clean… but, beautiful… :)</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Lovely Colors!</p>
    
</div>

<p>And guess what, ladies and gentlemen, three months have passed and I still haven’t completed the train… ^_^”</p>

<p>I did manage to make one carriage - the green one. Yet, the combination of the difficulty in making the holes on the thick roll and the lack of the right tool simply put me off. The little guy had also managed to break it even before I got the chance to take a picture of it… :S</p>

<p>So, the four other rolls sat on my desk for the longest time.</p>

<p>One down… though only recently, when I decided to turn it into a lion to accompany our <a href="http://schooloffun.wordpress.com/2011/01/22/little-bunny-foo-foo/">Little Bunny Foo Foo</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>The little guy seemed to like it very much. For a couple of days, he would bring the lion and the rabbit inside his bag whenever we went for a walk.</p>

<p>It also seems that he would make a good storyteller, too… :)</p>

<p>Now… if I could just figure out what other characters to make out of the other 3 rolls… ^_^</p>
