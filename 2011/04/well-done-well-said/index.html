        <p>It was an early Saturday morning. At least, early enough for a person who had been <a href="http://schooloffun.wordpress.com/2011/04/02/the-busy-panda/">spending late nights</a> nearly the whole week.</p>

<p>The little guy was, of course, Mr. Oblivious. He knows no calendar. He knows no time. When he thinks it is time for him to wake up, he will.</p>

<p>He would then roam around and play with whatever catches his interest first. Last Saturday, it was the 6-pot paint strip that comes with the Paint-Your-Own Wooden Race Car that I bought for my husband last Christmas.</p>

<p>It might be a present I gave to my husband. Yet, that box had been sitting inside the little guy’s room ever since it got unwrapped. The little guy had declared to all that the wooden race is his the moment he managed to open the box… :P</p>

<p>Still, he had never really played with the paint strip until that Saturday morning.</p>

<p>Slowly, he approached his dad.</p>

<p>What happened next really made us jump out of the bed: The little guy said his first fullest, longest sentence ever without our help! “Daddy… may I … have color, please? Thank you.”</p>

<p>Forget about the wrong choice of words. Or even the grammar. That sentence, coming from a toddler who adopts the principle of “Actions speak louder than words” most of the time, was really something that we should appreciate.</p>

<p>Gee, what am I saying?! This calls for a celebration! We had been waiting for this moment for the longest time ever!</p>

<p>And so began the father-son bonding activity. Hee hee.. yup, that was our way to celebrate… ;)</p>

<p>Me? Hee hee… I chose to stay on the sidelines this time. Hey, I should not be too greedy… I’ve got my shares of painting during the weekdays! :)</p>

<p>Anyway, the wooden race car got more colorful in no time.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">... Getting More Colorful...</p>
    
</div>

<p>I couldn’t help but to think that it was certainly the best kind of gifts. No assembly required. Just paint, and you would get one personalised car to show off and play with. Yeah, can’t agree more with you… <em>_nod, nod_</em> the person who chose this fun gift is indeed a very thoughtful person! Mwahaha… <em>_grinz_</em></p>

<p>After a while, staying on the sidelines was, of course, boring. So, I left the two guys to have fun on their own while I prepared breakfast.</p>

<p>I absolutely had no idea what happened later on. Somehow, when I came back, the final product seems to have different colors from what I saw at the beginning… :P The hood was no longer blue. It is now pitch black!</p>

<p>Hee hee… It looks cool, though… ;)</p>
