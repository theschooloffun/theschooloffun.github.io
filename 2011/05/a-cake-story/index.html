        <p>This was what happened when the little guy refused to take a nap when his mommy was dying to try out a recipe: the little guy got to bake a butter cake! :)</p>

<p>It was kinda difficult at first. I would say it took me longer to complete the whole thing.</p>

<p>More mess to clean up was inevitable. No one else was around at home. Otherwise, I could have had an extra pair of eyes to watch what the little guy was doing and prevent any spill.</p>

<p>The little guy also enjoyed the whole experience. So, for certain things, I decided to just let him play for a little longer.</p>

<p>But, overall, it wasn’t a recipe for disaster to get him involved… ;) We both had fun!</p>

<p>So, what exactly did he get to do?</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Measurement</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>This part was the reason why I said “it was kinda difficult at first”. I had to do this part, yet at the same time, I had to make sure the little guy didn’t add anything to what I’d measured.  And yup, I also had to make sure he didn’t throw or spill anything… :P</p>

<p>He was already very excited by then. So, to keep him away from my butter and flour, I let him measure the raisins. Obviously not the main ingredients… so I really didn’t mind if he didn’t put enough… :P And even if he put more than enough, I certainly wouldn’t object either. The more, the merrier….;) <em>_grinz_</em></p>

<p>He also helped me mixing the raisins with some flour… :)</p>

<p><strong>2. Preparing the Tin</strong></p>

<p>After I greased the tin, I let him do the flouring part.</p>

<p>He must have thought the tin was a kind of drum… :P He kept tapping the tin and giggled!</p>

<p><strong>3. Sifting the Flour</strong></p>

<p>I know, I know… Everything about it spells messy.</p>

<p>Although it was easy to see that he enjoyed playing with the flour very much, it wasn’t that great an idea to actually let him do this part. Hey, I did try to minimize the mess… I laid down newspaper underneath. So, everything seemed to be under control at first… :P</p>

<p>Then I went to put the flour … lo and behold, somebody tried to be helpful! The little guy followed behind me, pulling the newspaper with him… :P</p>

<p>Yup, we’ve got flour …all over the floor!  &gt;_&lt;</p>

<p><strong>4. Mixing</strong></p>

<p>Ah, the joy when we finally reached this part!</p>

<p>The little guy loved it when I held his hand along with the mixer. He also loved to play with the spatula… thankfully, he didn’t think of flicking a spatula full of the cake batter… :P</p>

<p><strong>5. Cleaning Up</strong></p>

<p>Yayy.. almost done!</p>

<p>He actually helped me with the dishes! :’)</p>

<p>And, finally… our big reward… tadaaa… ^o^</p>

<p>Hmmm… I think it calls for a tea time party! :D</p>
