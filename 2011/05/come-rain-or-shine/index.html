        <p>I used to think erratic weather only harms the wildlife. Or at most, various harvest products. Yet, spending 24 hours a day with a toddler at home makes me realize that erratic weather also does affect the life of a toddler… :P</p>

<p>It upsets him when he couldn’t go to the playground when the urge strikes. And to think that this urge often strikes exactly at the wrong time, e.g. when it’s raining cats and dogs or when the sun is scorching hot, I really should devise a plan to avoid a meltdown and keep my sanity intact… ^_^”</p>

<p>Since late last month, I find that keeping a box of ice cubes in the freezer helps, especially if <a href="http://schooloffun.wordpress.com/2011/02/25/a-fish-tale/">they are in the shape of a fish</a>… <em>_grinz_</em></p>

<p>I don’t bother to put food coloring anymore, though… Just to make the aftermath slightly less messy. Hee hee… :P</p>

<p>Unfortunately, without the food coloring, it is kinda difficult to see the fish the moment we put it in the tub. Thankfully, we have some colorful plastic rings to put on each cube.</p>

<p>The little guy could spend more than half an hour catching fish. It could be more if only I let him… He would use his hands or a strainer.</p>

<p>The plastic rings also allow him to use chopsticks to catch the fish. Another venue for him to practice his chopstick skill… :)</p>

<p>Of course, during this hot weather, our fish supply runs out pretty fast. We usually then continue to enjoy our water play using some cups and containers.</p>

<p>We really love that long neck plastic bottle. The little guy is at the stage where he loves seeing the bubbles that are formed when he pours the water into that bottle. The bubbles pop very quickly, yet he would giggle for long enough!</p>

<p>He would giggle even longer when I place some rings inside… :P</p>
