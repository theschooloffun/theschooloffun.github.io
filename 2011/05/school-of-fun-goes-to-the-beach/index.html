        <p>When it was raining heavily on a Saturday morning, we thought the weather would be just nice in the afternoon… :) So, we got our bags ready and went to the beach.</p>

<p>I suppose we were quite right about the weather. It was, however, a bit too sunny to handle after a while. With the little guy around, we simply had so many things that we could do at the beach. And guess what, we brought almost everything that we needed, except one: sunblock… &gt;_&lt;</p>

<p>Oh well… let’s just hope a little sunburn wouldn’t hurt… :)</p>

<p>Let’s just take a look at what we managed to accomplish there… ;)</p>

<p><strong>1. Chasing the waves and getting wet</strong></p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/05/174_beach_01.jpg" title="Again, Daddy!" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/05/174_beach_01.jpg" alt="Again, Daddy!" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Again, Daddy!</p>
    
</div>

<p>Okie… I think that probably also includes building some muscles for the little guy’s daddy… :P</p>

<p><strong>2. Counting Ships</strong></p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/05/174_beach_021.jpg" title="One, Two, Three..." target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/05/174_beach_021.jpg" alt="One, Two, Three..." /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">One, Two, Three...</p>
    
</div>

<p>Okie, not really… there were more boats than ships to count. Both made the little guy excited anyway… :) They could even make him sit quietly like a mermaid for some time. Hee heee… &gt;:P</p>

<p><strong>3. Sand Play</strong></p>

<p>Going to the beach just wouldn’t be complete without playing with the sand. We bought some sand molds as well as a plastic watering can. Just the perfect combination!</p>

    <p class="image-caption">The Busy Builder</p>
    
</div>

<p>Seriously, we could have spent longer time at the beach if only the sun wasn’t that fierce!</p>

<p>We certainly look forward to another trip to the beach… :)</p>
