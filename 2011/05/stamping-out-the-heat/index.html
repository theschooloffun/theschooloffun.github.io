        <p>As the weather gets too hot, it just gets difficult to think of anything fancy to do with the little guy. Well, except water play, of course… but that shall be in another post… :)</p>

<p>So, when the little guy asked to paint, I just handed him a paint brush and 2 bottles of paint.</p>

<p>I sat next to him, but honestly, at first I didn’t really feel like painting… :P I was just there to make sure he didn’t paint anything that he shouldn’t… hee hee…</p>

<p>And guess what he wanted to paint?</p>

<p>Come on, give it a try. It isn’t that hard to guess…</p>

<p>Well, his feet, of course! ^_^”</p>

<p>Nowadays, it’s kinda difficult to find an artwork of his that doesn’t have any footprints… :P</p>

<p>Since there were some <a href="http://www.megabrands.com/">Mega Bloks</a> lying around, I just quickly grabbed one of them and showed the little guy how to paint and stamp it on the paper.</p>

<p>Ha! Certainly the quickest way to stop him from painting his feet! :P</p>

<p>I was glad he wasn’t painting his feet and making a mess (which was something I didn’t look forward to in this hot weather!), while the little guy was happy he could still stamping something… Perfect!</p>

<p>And we all got to admire something cool… :P</p>

<p>Yup, it turned out to be a cool thing to do in the hot weather after all.</p>

<p>But, seriously, if somebody could just pass me the thermostat… It’s getting atrociously hot here… :S</p>
