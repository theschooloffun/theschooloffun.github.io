        <p>I’d been wanting to try making this <a href="http://madebyjoel.com/2011/03/blow-fish-toy.html">blow fish toy</a> ever since I saw it.</p>

<p>Yet, when we finally managed to make our own fish, somehow neither of us could make the fish move by blowing… :P We could only move the fish by pushing and pulling it along the line. Probably the combination of the wrong straw (we used a big straw) and the wrong kind of string (we used a thick yarn) just makes our fish sluggish.</p>

<p>Still, the little guy loves it. So, I decided to put one end higher. That way, we could just leave it to the gravity to make the fish zoom down the line… ;)</p>

<p>It was also just a matter of time to see another favorite thing of his being added to the line.</p>

<p>Very simple to make, yet very fun to play with… :)</p>

<p>Sadly, while no fish was harmed during this game, I must admit that my wall became a victim as soon as we started playing… :(</p>

<p>Obviously, the little guy thought he was so light that the yarn could sustain his weight as he jumped around… :P He must have thought that yarn was a kind of jumping rope… &gt;_&lt;</p>

<p>I should be more careful next time… ^_^”</p>
