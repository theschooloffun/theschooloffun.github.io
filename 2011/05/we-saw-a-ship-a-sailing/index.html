        <p>The little guy was recently into boats and ships. So far, we only have one small boat for him to play with. He would play with it every now and then… He would even bring it along when he was about to take a nap… &gt;_&lt;</p>

<p>Interestingly, he also kept asking to do the boat puzzle! For once, the train puzzle, which he used to solve first before moving to other jigsaw puzzles, seemed to be forgotten…</p>

<p>This certainly called for another boat to be made!</p>

<p><strong>What we had</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>paint</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>paintbrush</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>paper plate</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>drawing paper</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>black marker</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>scissors</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Let the Fun Begin!</strong></p>

<p>First, I cut a long slit… err, maybe I shouldn’t really call it a slit… I actually made it wavy, instead of straight, since I really wanted it to look like waves.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Not Really a Slit</p>
    
</div>

<p>The next step required my little painter to paint the ocean and the sky… :)</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/05/179_boat_02.jpg" title="The Blue Ocean" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/05/179_boat_02.jpg" alt="The Blue Ocean" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">The Blue Ocean</p>
    
</div>

<p>See how I folded the paper plate? Obviously, it was hard to convince the little guy to leave the “sky” away from that blue paint… :P Just see that tint of blue on the “sky” in the picture below!</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/05/179_boat_03.jpg" title="The Sky and the Ocean" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/05/179_boat_03.jpg" alt="The Sky and the Ocean" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">The Sky and the Ocean</p>
    
</div>

<p>We didn’t stop painting there. The little guy asked for the green paint and smudged it on the “ocean”. He also painted his feet green to stamp on a drawing paper… :S I must admit that, ever since we did our <a href="http://schooloffun.wordpress.com/2011/03/11/the-little-guy…project-runway/">project runway</a>, the little guy considers this feet painting a must-do before we end our painting session.</p>

<p>Anyway, while he was busy painting his feet, I drew a boat on one of his <a href="http://schooloffun.wordpress.com/2011/04/23/happy-easter/">marble painting artworks</a>.  After cutting it out, I pasted it on a small bookmark which we got during the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games. Initially, I wanted to paste it on a ice cream stick. Too bad, I somehow couldn’t find that stick… :S</p>

<p>And finally…</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/05/179_boat_06.jpg" title="A Boat on the Water" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/05/179_boat_06.jpg" alt="A Boat on the Water" /></a>

<p>… off we went sailing! :)</p>

<p><em>I saw a ship a-sailing,</em><br />
<em>A-sailing on the sea.</em><br />
<em>And, oh, but it was laden</em><br />
<em>With pretty things for thee.</em></p>

<p>It turned out that the size of the hole was just perfect for the little guy’s finger. This paper boat could go up and down, left and right as the little guy pull the bookmark using his finger.</p>

<p>If you’re thinking of making something similar, you might want to stick some clear tapes on the left and right sides of the long slit. Especially if you have a rough toddler like the little guy… :P My strong little guy tore one of the sides on his first attempt to operate his boat… :S</p>

<p>And oh, speaking about boats, did you know that if you put a small drop of liquid soap in the hole of a bread tag, you could turn your bread tag into a little speedboat? Go on, give <a href="http://sciencesquad.questacon.edu.au/activities/soap_powered_boat.html">it</a> a try! ;)</p>
