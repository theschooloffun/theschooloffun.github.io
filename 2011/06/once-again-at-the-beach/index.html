        <p>We had just spent another day at the beach last week. We thought it would be great to visit Siloso beach on a weekday before the school holiday kicked in.</p>

<p>And yup, we were right. It felt like having the beach for ourselves!</p>

<p>Hm… come to think of it, maybe it actually had nothing to do with whether it was school holiday or not. It was atrociously hot that day. So, I guess everyone else, except us, was wise enough to stay away from the beach… ^_^”</p>

<p>Oh well, we did have a great time anyway.</p>

<p>Where was the little guy, you ask?</p>

<p>He was busy playing with the shadows and sand, while tailing his dear uncle.</p>
