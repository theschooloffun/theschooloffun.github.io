        <p>When we visited an art supply store in the downtown area last month,  we decided to just get that roller sponge brush. I had been thinking of getting one when I first saw it long time ago, but I kept telling myself to just use normal sponge instead. People use rollers when they want do a quick job when painting a wide area. Us? We never really paint on anything bigger than A3 paper! Moreover, we haven’t quite ventured into water-based paints yet.</p>

<p>In short, we bought it simply because the price tag was nothing, as compared to the transportation cost incurred to get there. I would certainly scream at myself if one day I had to drag myself all the way there again just to get such a small item.</p>

<p>The little guy, however, thought the roller was a cool thing to play with as soon as I handed it over to him. Although he didn’t really make that “vroom… vroom” sound when he played with it, he must have thought it was the latest model of a dump truck or something…. :P How else could you explain why he rolled it all around the house?!</p>

<p>It was a different story when I finally gave him some paint to use the roller with. Probably a clean freak’s worst nightmare…</p>

<p>He turned the drawing paper into a wet sponge! &gt;_&lt; Eeeks…</p>

<p>The drawing paper was soon too wet to appreciate. Let alone to keep. And don’t get me started describing how messy the floor was… (I forgot to laid out some newspaper!)… &gt;_&lt;</p>

<p>We decided to just keep a portion of it and left it to dry overnight.<br />
It somehow reminded us of the scenes in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mister-Seahorse-Eric-Carle/dp/0399242694">Eric Carle’s Mister Seahorse</a>.</p>

<p>And, yup, we saw another opportunity to do snap painting… :)</p>

<p>We then cut out our seahorse from<a href="http://schooloffun.wordpress.com/2011/04/23/happy-easter/"> an old masterpiece of his</a>.</p>

<p>Cute, eh?</p>

<p>I think we’ll name our seahorse Mister Roley… :)</p>

<p>And oh, he makes just the perfect gift for this year’s Father’s day!</p>
