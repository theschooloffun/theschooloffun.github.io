        <p>I bet this happens to almost all other parents, too.</p>

<p>We think of something fun and cool to do with our little ones so that we could spend some quality time with them, only to find that they are not as interested in it as we expect them to be. I know, kids are kids. They could get easily distracted at times. Still, I have not yet come to terms with the fact that he ditched one such fun activity for a small box called iPad.</p>

<p>I know. Sadly, technology engages and distracts… ^_^”</p>

<p>Just like when we did our snap painting, an activity suggested in one of <a href="http://www.gryphonhouse.com/authors/index.asp?ID=KOHM">MaryAnn Kohl’</a>s books (I can’t remember which one, though…).</p>

<p>At first, I thought we got off on the right foot. The little guy watched closely as I stretched some rubber bands over a plastic container. He was also excited when I asked him to put some paint on those rubber bands.</p>

<p>I taught him how he could pull the rubber bands and snap them, just like playing guitar. He seemed to think it was cool, especially with the sound effect and the splashy print they made.</p>

<p>However, after less than than 5 minutes, he asked to play with my brother’s iPad… &gt;<em>&lt; *_sob, sob</em>* He no longer showed any interest to continue with the painting! Arrrgh…. speaking of the dawn of technology in the house!</p>

<p>This is all we could get that day.</p>
