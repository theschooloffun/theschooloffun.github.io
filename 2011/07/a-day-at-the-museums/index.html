        <p>We made the trip to several museums exactly last month. Yet, it was only recently that I could sort through the photos and finally write something about it… &gt;_&lt;</p>

<p>I know. I couldn’t believe it myself. It felt like it was just yesterday we packed so much fun into a day!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nationalmuseum.sg/EventDetail.aspx?id=262&amp;cat=5"><strong>The Playdome at National Museum of Singapore</strong></a></p>

<p>We reached the museum quite early, about 1040 AM. I thought we would just visit the Playdome, but a friendly staff approached us. She somehow managed to coax us into joining their 45-min interactive tour.</p>

<p>At first, I was rather reluctant. I thought it would be too much for the little guy to handle. The thought of having to chase the little guy, keeping him away from anything breakable, was just too daunting.</p>

</div>

<p>In the end, it was not that kind of tour I imagined. The story-telling and role playing had the little guy’s attention from start to end. Geee… I wish I’m just as good as those guides!</p>

<p>Anyway, we then decided to go to the Garden @ The Playdome first before it got too hot to play out there.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">...To See the Umbrella</p>
    
</div>

<p>Next, we visited the Black Box.</p>

<p>The giant kaleidoscope quickly won his heart.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Mesmerized...</p>
    
</div>

<p>There was also a Wayang Play stage not far from the kaleidoscope. After exploring the stage, the little guy sat down to color his face-mask. My tired feet really wished we could stay there longer, but the little guy still thought the kaleidoscope was the coolest thing ever and that he shouldn’t waste his time anywhere else… :P</p>

<p>When I finally managed to drag him away from the kaleidoscope, we visited the 2 1/2 D cinema. The idea was to let him experience “being inside a movie”. The little guy, however, thought we were playing shadow puppets… :P</p>

<p>And that was how we got all those silly poses… :P</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Walking on Water</p>
    
</div>

<p>We also visited the Clay Musescapes at the Sensory Lab.</p>

<p>The little guy may be too young to make anything significant there, but he was certainly an expert in squeezing things… :P I am just glad we went out of the place without destroying anything… ^_^”</p>

<p><strong>Art Garden: Children’s Season at Singapore Art Museum</strong></p>

<p>After lunch, we decided to visit the Art Museum. Not only was it free, but it also turned out that they were in the midst of transforming the museum for the Children’s Season!</p>

<p>The whole museum was like a playground to the little guy. Even the elephant statue…</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->

    <p class="image-caption">The Dancing Tot and the Playful Elephant</p>
    
</div>

<p>Instead of posing nicely in front of the elephant when I took out my camera, the little guy went to dance around the elephant. Tsk tsk… The lunch had certainly given him an energy boost!</p>

<p>There was also a three-tiered cake (it was supposed to be a cake for mommy! <em>_grinz_</em>) for him to decorate and some dolls to dress up, using his favorite: velcro.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Green and Yellow for Her...</p>

<p>And look who also got to paint in the museum (at the Tree of Love)…</p>

<p>At the Paper Fruit Market, we took the template to make a paper orange, which the little guy happily cut out. He didn’t have the patience to wait for the glue to dry, though… We just brought it home to make later on.</p>

<p>Too bad the Paramodelic-Graffiti that was built out of toy train tracks wasn’t ready for us to explore yet… Otherwise, the little guy would certainly have loved to spend more time there…</p>

<p>Oh well, it was supposed to be a day at the museums anyway. Not a night at the museums… :P</p>
