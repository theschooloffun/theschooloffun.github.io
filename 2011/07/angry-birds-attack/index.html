        <p>Ahh… the freedom.</p>

<p>After dealing with a vicious case of stomach flu - during and after the holiday - for the longest time ever, the little guy and I have officially recovered. Fully. It really feels great to finally be able to go around without having to think whether we could find a toilet fast enough if anything should happen… :P</p>

<p>And so, on Saturday, off we went to an art supply store.</p>

<p>No, we didn’t actually need to get anything there. Yet, the sight of the colorful stationery and paint nearly made me empty my wallet… &gt;_&lt;</p>

<p>Thankfully, chasing a toddler proved to be a great way to curb compulsive spending. Yet, on the other hand, feeling tired after chasing a toddler, we contemplated sending him to one of the art workshops there, just so that we could “rest” for a while… :P There you go, we did spend after all!</p>

<p>It happened that <a href="http://www.jumpingclay.co.uk/">Jumping Clay</a> was running an Angry Birds workshop that afternoon. Being a true blue Angry Birds fan, the little guy watched curiously as two older kids were busy making their red angry birds with the instructors.</p>

<p>It really looked interesting. You see, Jumping Clay is something like Playdoh, but when it dries, it becomes light weight. Almost like <a href="http://www.sculpey.com/">Sculpey</a>, minus the baking part.</p>

<p>Anyway, the instructor really had to work hard while helping the little guy make his angry bird. At one time, when he tried to put one of the eyes, he squeezed both the red and white clays together. Bwahaha… If only the instructor didn’t get him a new set, the little guy would certainly get himself an angry bird that looks like a flat pizza!</p>

<p>In the end, they somehow managed to complete one cute angry bird.</p>

</div>

<p>While we waited for the clay to dry, my husband saw another workshop taking place not far inside: tile painting. If I went on my own, I would certainly not consider taking part. Showing any brush and paint to the little guy equals to getting ourselves to bring home an abstract painting… :P</p>

<p>Yet, as the workshop offered free membership to the art supply store, we decided to participate.</p>

<p>The two of them immediately bonded over their love of painting.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Father and Son</p>
    
</div>

<p>Sadly, the above lovey-dovey scene didn’t last for long. The little guy quickly decided that he was a better painter and wanted to take over the brush from his daddy. So, I had to take him to sit next to his dad instead and let him continue painting on the paper covered table.</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/07/212_bird_031.jpg" title="On His Own" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/07/212_bird_031.jpg" alt="On His Own" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">On His Own</p>
    
</div>

<p>Only then could his daddy continue painting and carefully hide the smudge the little guy made. Once in a while, he got the little guy to help coloring some parts of the painting.</p>

<p>Wanna guess what they painted?</p>

<p>And so that’s the story of how we went home bringing two Angry Birds artworks.</p>

<p>Tsk tsk.. Our household has certainly been attacked by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angry_Birds">Angry Birds</a> fever… ^_^”</p>
