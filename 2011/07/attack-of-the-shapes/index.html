        <p>This is what happened to our living room as we learned about shapes last week.</p>

<p>The rule of the game was that the little guy had to close his eyes and take one of the shapes I made using construction paper.</p>

<p>He then had to run or jump into the same shape while shouting the name of the shape.</p>

<p>But, of course, mommy’s rules are meant to be broken… :P As you could see in the picture above, he preferred to use the masking tape as roads for his cars.</p>

<p>That evening, with his daddy, he even drew on one of the shapes to turn it into a railway!</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/07/233_shape_03.jpg" title="Quick, Daddy... Thomas needs this railway!" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/07/233_shape_03.jpg" alt="Quick, Daddy... Thomas needs this railway!" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Quick, Daddy... Thomas needs this railway!</p>
    
</div>

<p>Meanwhile, that night, as I lied on the bed, I kept thinking how on earth I would be able to sweep and mop the floor the following morning. I was pretty sure that the little guy wouldn’t let me take off any of those shapes.</p>

<p>And, yup, I was right. The following morning and many mornings after, he shouted at me whenever he saw me trying to peel the tape. He watched closely as I cleaned the house, making sure I wouldn’t take any of his shapes away.</p>

<p>He also created different kinds of games for himself to play with his shapes, like this matching game.</p>

<p>And finally, after putting up with these masking tapes for nearly a week, I managed to peel them off first thing in the morning before he woke up. I made sure I left no trace behind. In fact, it was so clean that even the little guy didn’t remember anything about it! Great! :)</p>
