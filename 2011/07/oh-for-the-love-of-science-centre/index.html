        <p>Don’t we all just love <a href="http://www.science.edu.sg/Pages/SCBHome.aspx">Science Centre</a>?!</p>

<p>No, I have no intention to turn the little guy into a little Einstein by bringing him there often. For now, I could simply forget about the educational part of it… :P</p>

<p>Yet, for now, for this mother of this toddler who just can’t sit still, it’s like… heaven. It is a place safe enough that I could just let him roam around and save my energy. It is also a place where the little guy could just touch nearly everything, without getting shouted at by his mommy… :P In fact, he <em>is</em> encouraged to touch these interactive exhibits! It is plainly: touch and be merry! Whoohooo… just how cool is that!?</p>

<p>And guess what, I don’t really need to exercise my muscles, carrying or restraining him, as we could rent a buggy there! Now that is what I call mother-friendly… :P</p>

<p>Although he may be too young to understand anything, there is one area that we never fail to miss whenever we visit the centre: Discovery Zone. Everything there is just fun to touch or watch. I love to go to the hatchery where, if we’re lucky, we could see some a chick hatches from its egg. The little guy, however, loves the little houses where he could play peek-a-boo… :P</p>

<p>Usually, there are lots of kids about his age, too. So, yup, lots of kids to play with and to smack. Oh, don’t worry, so far, the little guy hasn’t smacked anyone yet. With such a huge amount of fun he has there, I don’t think he would want to smack anyone either … 0:) There are better things for everyone to do than smack people around!</p>

<p>The little guy also likes to explore the crawl-through space where he could see both cute (such as hamster) and creepy animals (such as cockroach). He also apparently finds it exciting (he even laughs at me!) seeing me bending down to be able to get inside while he could effortlessly run around inside… ^_^”</p>

<p>But to him, nothing could beat his favorite place: WaterWorks! He could easily spend more than half an hour, soaking up all the fun there while his mommy is happily and comfortably sitting on the side… <em>_grinz_</em></p>

<p>And when it’s time to head home, I know for sure somebody would just fall asleep peacefully on the way home…</p>
