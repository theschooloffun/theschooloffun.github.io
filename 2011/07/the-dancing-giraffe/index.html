        <p>There’s nothing new about this little curious cook aka the little guy that I have at home. He seems to rate my kitchen utensils way above his toy collection. Whatever I do in the kitchen never seems to fail to amaze him.</p>

<p>Like when I cut some potatoes into cubes. There was no way I could escape from letting him try when he was that wide awake…</p>

</div>

<p>With a bread knife instead of a proper knife, the little guy just had to cut corners… So, instead of nice cubes, we got some nice_ unidentified <em>shapes</em>… :P_</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Too Nice to Throw...</p>
    
</div>

<p>Yes, they were certainly too nice to throw.</p>

<p>Since the little guy recently likes to read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Giraffes-Cant-Dance-Giles-Andreae/dp/0439287197">Giraffes Can’t Dance by Giles Andreae</a>, I thought we should use those potatoes to make our own giraffe… :)</p>

<p><strong>What we had</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>paper</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>marker</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>scissors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>brown paint</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>potato pieces</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Let the Fun Begin!</strong></p>

<p>All I needed to do was to draw a giraffe on a construction paper. The rest of the steps, well except the cutting, of course, was the little guy’s to complete… :)</p>

<p>Yup, he just needed to dip the potato pieces into the paint and start stamping. That easy!</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Stamp!</p>
    
</div>

<p>Fast and easy, in fact. I even had to find another way to entertain him while we waited for it to dry, giving him another episode of Being the Curious Cook.</p>

<p>There was, however, one problem. As the picture of the giraffe was plain at first (i.e. no patches), the little guy insisted that it was a horse, not a giraffe. So, when we finally got our giraffe ready, he kept calling it, “Dancing horse!”</p>
