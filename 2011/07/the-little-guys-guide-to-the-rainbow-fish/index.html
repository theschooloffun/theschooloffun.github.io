        <p>There’s always a certain thrill to ransack daddy’s treasure box and find something exciting among your loot.</p>

<p>Like this box full of barely used watercolor paint tubes.</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/07/228_fish_01.jpg" title="Finders, Keepers! Ours!" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/07/228_fish_01.jpg" alt="Finders, Keepers! Ours!" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Finders, Keepers! Ours!</p>
    
</div>

<p>After forcefully claiming the whole box as ours, we decided to paint something. We didn’t have to look hard to find an inspiration, especially since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rainbow-Fish-Marcus-Pfister/dp/1558580093">The Rainbow Fish</a> is among the books we read for this week.</p>

<p><strong>What we had</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>drawing paper</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>pencil</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>black marker</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>scissors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>watercolor paints</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>paint brush</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>salt</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>water</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>cling wrap</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Let the Fun Begin!</strong></p>

<p>First, I drew the fish in pencil on the drawing paper.</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/07/228_fish_02.jpg" title="Ready to Paint" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/07/228_fish_02.jpg" alt="Ready to Paint" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Ready to Paint</p>
    
</div>

<p>That was about all for my part, except for the outlining later on. The rest of the steps were left for the little guy.</p>

<p>After countless painting sessions, it seems natural that he immediately wanted to take one paint brush and start dabbling on the paper. Luckily, I was fast enough to direct him to paint only with water first. Otherwise, he would miss the part where he could see how different paints blend together making new colors.</p>

    <a href="/uploads/2011/07/228_fish_03.jpg" title="Super Strong Brush Stroke" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/07/228_fish_03.jpg" alt="Super Strong Brush Stroke" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Super Strong Brush Stroke</p>
    
</div>

<p>And that, ladies and gentlemen, makes any painting done by even a 2-year-old look like an exquisite work of art… :P</p>

<p>The next step was his favorite: sprinkling salt. The salt would create a nice texture for the scales as it absorbs the water in the paint and make the area beneath it lighter. I realize I shouldn’t have used fine salt, though… The textural effect would certainly have been more obvious if I use coarse salt.</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/07/228_fish_04.jpg" title="With a Pinch of Salt" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/07/228_fish_04.jpg" alt="With a Pinch of Salt" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">With a Pinch of Salt</p>
    
</div>

<p>The little guy really loved this part so much that he even continued to sprinkle on the “water” painting, which he basically painted in blue using a big brush.</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/07/228_fish_05.jpg" title="More Salt, Please..." target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/07/228_fish_05.jpg" alt="More Salt, Please..." /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">More Salt, Please...</p>
    
</div>

<p>Thankfully, I didn’t pass him one whole bottle of salt. In fact, it was really wise to put some salt in a small container for him to use. He ended up pouring the whole container on this painting… :P</p>

<p>While the blue paint was still wet, I quickly put cling wrap over the wet piece of paper and left it there until the paint dried.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Not Nicely Wrapped...</p>
    
</div>

<p>And we took it off, tadaaa… a nice textural pattern! Just the right pattern for our little fish to swim in… :)</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/07/228_fish_071.jpg" title="Feel Like Swimming?" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/07/228_fish_071.jpg" alt="Feel Like Swimming?" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Feel Like Swimming?</p>
    
</div>

<p>Here, let me put the fish inside. I’ve outlined the edges using a black marker and cut it out.</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/07/228_fish_08.jpg" title="Our Rainbow Fish" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/07/228_fish_08.jpg" alt="Our Rainbow Fish" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Our Rainbow Fish</p>
    
</div>

<p>Look nice, eh? All the tricks have certainly made it hard to believe that this painting was done by a 2-year-old! And best of all, this 2-year-old really enjoyed himself throughout the process… :)</p>

<p>Oh, by the way, see the sequins there? Yup, we’re ready to re-read The Rainbow Fish and show how a good fish shares its glittering sequins, oops… I mean, scales… :)</p>
