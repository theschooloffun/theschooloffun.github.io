        <p>We (finally) ran out of green crayola kids’ paint.</p>

<p>Uhm, okie, we do have a new set somewhere in the house. Let’s just say I was too lazy to go and find it.</p>

<p>Yet, the urge to make something was there… ^_^”</p>

<p>Thankfully, there was a handful of crepe paper from a leftover pile in my room. And so we began our painting journey without any real paint… :P</p>

<p><strong>What we had</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>drawing paper</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>crepe paper</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>water</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>scissors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>paint brushes</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Let the Fun Begin!</strong></p>

<p>Since I simply wanted to make a patch of green, I just had to cut a big piece of green crepe paper to place on top of the drawing paper.</p>

<p>Then, I showed the little guy how he could dip his paint brush in water and start “painting” on the crepe paper. Basically, we just need to brush the water over the paper, completely covering every part.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Flood!</p>
    
</div>

<p>Ahh… the joy! Just give this toddler of ours a paint brush and water, and he would giggle non-stop as he flicks his brush, sloshing water everywhere… :P</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/07/234_crepe_03.jpg" title="Done!" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/07/234_crepe_03.jpg" alt="Done!" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Done!</p>
    
</div>

<p>It does mean that he took forever to complete something that he could have easily done in a minute or two. But, hey, ten minutes of this kind of activity is _so _much better than getting roasted under the scorching hot sun!</p>

<p>Next, we carefully pulled the crepe paper off. The little guy, of course, made sure he did it with style.</p>

<p>He completely lost interest in it when he was done peeling off the crepe paper. Somehow, the very same cars and trucks that he pushed aside earlier won his heart once again. I’m kind of used to it, so I really didn’t mind we stopped there… :)</p>

<p>A few days later, as we practiced snipping, I collected a handful of crepe paper pieces.</p>

<p>After a crash course to refresh him up on this activity, he carefully placed each piece on the green patch and started brushing the water over each piece.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Add Some Red</p>
    
</div>

<p>I helped him make a nice “fireworks” pattern, too… :)</p>

<p>Here’s how it looks after we left it to dry overnight.</p>

<p>There. Nice and easy, with no paint.</p>

<p>I guess that explains why I still haven’t gone to search for our new paint set yet… :P</p>
