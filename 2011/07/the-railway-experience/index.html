        <p>Recently, Tanjong Pagar Railway Station and the railway tracks seem to step back into the limelight after <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_685739.html">the station is closed for good</a>. It obviously didn’t take the railway tracks long to turn into the top go-to place for most people here. No doubt, some may want to reminisce the past. Yet, for most other people, like us, it is just hard to miss the excitement over walking on the abandoned tracks.</p>

<p>Having grown up near a railway, I always find great amusement in watching the trains go by. I always get excited when I hear the sound of the train and I love counting the number of freight cars! Yet, I never really thought about the tracks. In fact, walking on the tracks has always been something that I know I have to do only if really necessary and in a hurry! Now that we have the chance to enjoy walking on the abandoned tracks, of course I wouldn’t want to miss it!</p>

<p>So, with the little guy in tow, we walked the route from <a href="http://www.thegreencorridor.org/tag/choa-chu-kang-road/">Choa Chu Kang Road to Rail Mall</a>. It was almost like walking in a nature park, with the tracks as the added bonus. And true enough, it was hard not to get excited as we walked on the old tracks, especially if that was the little guy’s first time!</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Look! Two lines!</p>

<p>In addition, the kinds of things you could find on and along the tracks are simply … well, interesting. For sure, we found countless “orphaned” shoe soles. Hehehe.. I guess this serves as a reminder for any of you who is currently planning to explore the tracks: Make sure you wear comfy and sturdy shoes! Trust me, with all those gravels, you wouldn’t like the idea of losing your sole even if it is just another hundred of meters to complete the route.</p>

<p>We also found another unique “souvenir” probably left by other visitors… :P</p>

<p>While some other visitors, including the little guy, chose to build a monument on the tracks… :P</p>

<p>There was also this poor fellow which was stomped on … &gt;_&lt;</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Poor Ant...</p>
    
</div>

<p>We also saw a monkey crossing and a tiny spider, which the little guy then chased after using his car … :P</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Run, Spidey, Run!</p>

<p>Seeing him playing with his car on the track makes me regret not bringing some of his trains… :( I bet it would be fun to let him try his trains on the real tracks!</p>

<p>But, hey… he didn’t seem to mind! :P He really loves playing with his car on the tracks. He also loves asking his daddy to take a picture of his favorite car.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Again, Daddy!</p>

<p>All in all, we truly enjoyed ourselves! We even decided to continue with the route to <a href="http://www.thegreencorridor.org/2011/07/02/walking-route-from-rail-mall-to-bukit-timah-train-station/">Bukit Timah Train Station</a>. Too bad the train station wasn’t as grand as we expected…</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Bukit Timah Train Station</p>

<p>We did think about continuing with <a href="http://www.thegreencorridor.org/2011/07/07/walking-route-from-bukit-timah-train-station-to-holland-road/">the next route</a>. But, after that 5.6 km walk, I would be lying if I say my feet are fine. In fact, my feet still feel like jelly right now… :S</p>

<p>So, off we went, back to civilization…</p>

<p>And here, my friends, was the best reward for the day… mmmm… yum yum!</p>

<p>… and probably the best cough medicine, too! <em>_grinz_</em></p>

<p>Geee… now I feel like reading Edith Nesbit’s The Railway Children again!</p>
