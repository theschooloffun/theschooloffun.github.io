        <p>Remember when I told you that <a href="http://theschooloffun.com/2011/07/07/when-he-wanted-to-rock-the-boat/">3 out of 10 activities that I planned out for the little guy didn’t turn out as I expected</a>? This painting is one of the examples.</p>

    <a href="/uploads/2011/07/227_berry_01.jpg" title="Small and Big" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/07/227_berry_01.jpg" alt="Small and Big" /></a>

<p>It was meant to be a simple stamping activity using a toilet paper roll and his fingers to make a strawberry picture (See the small strawberry on the left? That was the example I gave him).</p>

<p>The little guy, on the other hand, had his own plan. He used his hands and fingers and painted a bigger strawberry on the right side… &gt;_&lt;</p>

<p>Looking at the final product, I initially didn’t feel like writing about it. After all, it was just another finger painting session – something that we do almost once a week. Trust me, I have a stack of his artworks which I haven’t posted, or don’t intend to post, here…:P</p>

<p>Looking at the horrid colors, I almost sent it to the dustbin, too. I guess the only reason the paper was still in the house is because I have been quite a procrastinator lately.</p>

<p>Looking at it once again, I thought I should give it another chance. At least, I should let it be useful one more time before, if I really decide to, I throw it into the dustbin of history.</p>

<p>So, I cut out some strawberry shapes using red and green construction paper. I let the little guy put some glue on the back and stick them on the painting.</p>

</div>

<p>I know, it still looks rather plain. But wait till you see what we did next!</p>

<p>We used correction pen to decorate our strawberries. At first, I thought of using a black marker. But I know the marker wouldn’t survive the violent blows the little guy could make… :p The correction pen really seems like the best solution.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Counting the Seeds...</p>
    
</div>

<p>No matter how awful the painting still looks now, it was certainly an interesting way to introduce him to the fact that strawberries have seeds on the outside, not inside. Uhmm… I know I shouldn’t really call them “seeds”, but how could I explain “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achene">achene</a>” to a 2-year-old and that strawberries are not really fruits? :P</p>
