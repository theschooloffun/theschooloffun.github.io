        <p>As wonderful as they look on the photos posted in this blog, I must admit that sometimes, say probably about 3 out of 10, the activities that I planned out for the little guy didn’t turn out as I expected. It could be because of his lack of interest (blame it to the terrible two!) or simply because he had a totally different idea on how to do things (again, blame it to the terrible two!). Even so, most of the time, the outcome could still be considered rather ‘positive’.</p>

<p>There are, however, some that give an outcome that I don’t quite fancy… :(</p>

<p>Like when I taught him how to blow water bubbles through a straw…</p>

    <a href="/uploads/2011/07/215_blow_01.jpg" title="Bubbles!" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/07/215_blow_01.jpg" alt="Bubbles!" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Bubbles!</p>
    
</div>

<p>I remember teaching him that before and there was no incident AT ALL. Yet, obviously this time, it just had to be different.</p>

<p>It started off as a lesson on how the wind could move a boat. We had our paper boat ready. So all we needed then was a little bit of gust.</p>

<p>Ah.. there! The little guy huffed and puffed with all his might…</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/07/215_blow_02.jpg" title="A Hurricane's A-blowing" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/07/215_blow_02.jpg" alt="A Hurricane's A-blowing" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">A Hurricane's A-blowing</p>
    
</div>

<p>Then we moved on to learning about waves: observing how the wind causes the waves and how the waves, in turn, would bring the boat up and down.</p>

<p>Too much for a 2-year-old? Most definitely!</p>

<p>It didn’t take him long to figure out that if he pushes the straw deeper instead, he would get bubbles…</p>

<p>Lots and lots of them….</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Who Needs Waves when You Have Bubbles?!</p>
    
</div>

<p>And see that cheeky smile?</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/07/215_blow_04.jpg" title="*gulp*" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/07/215_blow_04.jpg" alt="*gulp*" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">*gulp*</p>
    
</div>

<p>I knew it! He just took a gulp of the water… Yikes!</p>

<p>Fortunately, it was drinking water. Yet, I never thought that he would even try to suck at the straw…</p>

<p>And just as I tried to recover from the shock, he gave me a long “Ahhhhhh!”… and told me how yummy “the drink” was… Duh!</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/07/215_blow_051.jpg" title="Ahhhhh!" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/07/215_blow_051.jpg" alt="Ahhhhh!" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Ahhhhh!</p>
    
</div>

<p>So, people, the next time you want to try this, make sure you prepare clean drinking water. Just be prepared for the unexpected, will you…</p>
