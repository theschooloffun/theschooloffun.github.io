<p>When he saw those hand prints, he kept asking me to trace his hands. Then, he tried to trace his own hands. He drew tons of them. Yet, he refused to stick any of those blue hand prints to make what I had wanted him to make… :P</p>

<p>I was too excited to make this bird. I just couldn’t wait for him to finally have that mood. So, I decided to make this myself… ^_^”</p>

<p>Guess what he said when he saw the final product!</p>

<p>First… “Rio!” Well, okie… He got that right. I did want to make Blu from Rio.</p>

<p>Then… “Show Daddy…!”, exactly what he usually says after he completes an artwork on his own… except that he didn’t even help to make the bird…&gt;_&lt;</p>

<p>Tsk tsk…</p>

<p>Oh well, at least the background picture was painted by him. I guess that makes it our collaborative artwork! :)</p>
