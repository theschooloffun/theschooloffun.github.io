        <p>It’s been some time since we first heard about <a href="http://www.marinabaysands.com/Singapore-Entertainment/Activities/Art-Science-Museum">ArtScience Museum</a>, the new museum in town. And for months, I’ve been haunted by this feeling of “Hey! We should go and check it out!” and this other feeling of “It looks too expensive to visit with a 2-year-old!”… :S</p>

<p>Yesterday, the latter feeling finally gave way to the former. There are three exhibitions, so I thought it would be quite a good deal. It turned out, however, different number of exhibitions visited translates to different ticket price. There’s no such thing as one price for all. And to think that the ticket does not allow re-entry of the exhibition… eeeks … :S Sob sob…</p>

<p>Anyway, we were already at the counter. So, it didn’t feel right to just back out. We proceeded to buy tickets for two exhibitions. It still was a good deal, considering that the price for visiting 2 exhibitions does not mean twice the amount that we have to pay for visiting 1 exhibition. We also got a 20% discount, thanks to a certain credit card promotion. Plus, we’ve got ourselves a complimentary entry to the Shipwrecked Exhibition, thanks to the National Day Promotion. So, we got to visit all three exhibitions at the price of 2. Yayy… :)</p>

<p>And here we go… off to our journey… :) First, we visited the <strong>Van Gogh Alive</strong> Exhibition. The truth is, there is no real painting exhibited. But, you’d certainly love how they use the technology to project Van Gogh’s works on the wall, much like a giant canvas. The projection allows us to see his works from different angles, while the background music sets the mood. Interesting, indeed.</p>

<p>The little guy, too, enjoyed himself: dancing to the music and running around trying to “catch” the moving projection or shadow. Too bad no photography was allowed inside.</p>

<p>Outside the gallery, there are also some interactive games related to Van Gogh’s works that he could try. The games might be more for older kids, but the touch screen was obviously good enough to entertain him… :P</p>

<p>The next exhibition we visited was <strong>Shipwrecked: Tang Treasures and Monsoon Winds</strong>.</p>

<p>This time round, photography was allowed… yet, it was too dark to take decent pictures with my camera. The little guy got a little bit excited inside, while I got very worried that he would bang into someone or something. Overall, it was more like a hit-and-run. I could barely read any of the exhibition notes!</p>

<p>The only thing that managed to get his attention was the embossers.</p>

<p>The third exhibition, <strong>Dalí: Mind of a Genius</strong>, proves to be the most exciting. It makes our trip to the museum end on a sweet note. Reading his story and his quotes was already very entertaining, let alone admiring his upturned mustache and his works… :P Hee hee…</p>

<p>Certain parts of the exhibition might not be entertaining enough for the little guy. He must even be wondering why nobody sits on those comfortable sofas and why mommy shouts every time he tries to get any closer to the sofas… :P</p>

<p>Yet, some other parts made it hard to take him out from the gallery. Like this surreal elephant and the spotlights that the little guy could play with, making colorful shadows.</p>

<p>There is also this interesting table that makes a great runway for his cars… :P</p>

<p>We spent hours inside the museum, gaining more knowledge and exercising some muscles. The little guy also then continued to explore the open space outside.</p>

<p>No doubt he slept peacefully last night… :P</p>
