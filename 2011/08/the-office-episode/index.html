        <p>After getting more “No!”s than I could take from the little guy each time I suggested an activity, I finally gave in and let him decide what he wanted to do instead.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if he really meant it or if it was because of his recent preference for his daddy over me, but he blurted “Daddy… Office.”</p>

<p>And so, we drew out our plan… <em>_grinz_</em> or rather, it was a map to guide us on how to go to daddy’s office and what daddy usually does in the office… :P</p>

<p>Wearing one of his fave shirts, the little guy then “cycled” to daddy’s office.</p>

<p>While he was cycling to the office, our living room miraculously turned into an office with a nice typewriter and some hardworking bears (and a duck!) in crisp-looking shirts.</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/08/249_office_02.jpg" title="In the Office" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/08/249_office_02.jpg" alt="In the Office" /></a>

</div>

<p>Each of them was busy working on something. Oops.. that duck obviously read the wrong book… :P</p>

<p>The little guy quickly chose a role for himself, working intensely on the typewriter. Every now and then he would summon one of the bears and get it to work on the typewriter, too…</p>

    <a href="/uploads/2011/08/249_office_04.jpg" title="Your Turn, PeeWee..." target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/08/249_office_04.jpg" alt="Your Turn, PeeWee..." /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Your Turn, PeeWee...</p>
    
</div>

<p>For five days, this storyline seemed to continue be his favorite. He would ask me for the typewriter first thing in the morning. I even start to think that maybe it really was a good idea to get him to choose for himself…  :)</p>

<p>Too bad this happened on the fifth day…</p>

    <p class="image-caption">The Long, Messy Ribbon</p>
    
</div>

<p>Obviously, I didn’t realize that he had changed to another role on the fifth day! He probably had turned himself into a mechanic or simply someone who wanted to do a reverse engineering… :S</p>

<p>Poor typewriter! :(</p>
