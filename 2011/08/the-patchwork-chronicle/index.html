        <p>Sometimes I feel parenting a high-energy toddler doesn’t do justice to my brain. It’s just getting easier to put off doing something till I forget it. I actually doubt if there is any scientific reason behind. Yet, one great thing about parenting a toddler is that forgetfulness becomes understandable since I now have someone or something to point my finger at… :P _Oh, I’ve been busy with this… and that… _etc… etc …</p>

<p>There you go. I’ve laid down my excuses…</p>

<p>The truth is I’d put off writing an entry about this patchwork for so long (read: &gt; 1 month!) that I nearly forgot all about it! <em>_grinz_</em></p>

<p>And then I saw the little guy sleeping with his patchwork turtle… I thought I should quickly write this entry before another episode of forgetfulness… :P</p>

<p><strong>What we had</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>drawing paper</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>colorful felt pieces</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>marker</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>scissors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>glue</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Let the Fun Begin!</strong></p>

<p>Since we have lots of abstract paintings at home, we decided to reuse one of the as our “drawing paper”. I helped the little guy to draw a turtle. Don’t ask me why I drew a turtle… I simply can’t remember now… :P</p>

<p>All we needed to do next was sticking the colorful felt pieces. While this step is certainly no rocket science, it certainly took a truck to grab the little guy’s interest.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, it was amazing that he managed to complete his turtle within that same day.</p>

<p>When I came across a book titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elmer-Books-David-Mckee/dp/0688091717">Elmer by David McKee</a> in the library not long after he completed the turtle, I thought we should read that book and the rest of the Elmer books that we could find in the library. I also thought about making our own Elmer, just like how we made our turtle but more “structured”. This time, our felt pieces should only be either square or rectangular to make sure we get similar pattern like Elmer’s.</p>

<p>At first, it seemed to take his fancy. The little guy kept pointing the color on the book and asking me to find felt pieces with similar color. Yet, not long after, his interest started to subside. I left the felt pieces and the elephant on the table for that whole week, but he still didn’t seem to be interested to continue… <em>_sigh_</em></p>

<p>When Elmer finally emerged, the little guy was only showing a glimpse of his excitement in having his say on where to put the eye… <em>_sob, sob_</em></p>

<p>I guess he’s not that ready for anything too structured after all… :) It’s okay, we’ll take baby steps… ;)</p>
