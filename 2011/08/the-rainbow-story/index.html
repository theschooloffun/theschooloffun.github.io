        <p>I’m not sure if it is officially time to bid farewell to the hot, sunny weather. Yet, it’s been rainy and windy lately.</p>

<p>Pretty soon we could just forget about our usual walking or cycling around the neighborhood twice a day… eeks! That would mean finding lots of backup plans to entertain the little guy at home! I’m pretty sure he wouldn’t love the idea of being cooped up at home for the whole day.</p>

<p>I was totally caught by surprise when it rained this morning. I thought we could cycle somewhere while I let my mind wander to start <em>_ahem_</em> making the backup plans for this week and beyond. And with the heavy rain came too early, both the little guy and I could just watch as our bicycle got drenched… <em>_sob, sob_</em></p>

<p>It’s okay. People say there’s always rainbow after the rain. Never mind if we don’t really get to see the rainbow after each rain. I thought we ought to make our own rainbow, even when it was still raining outside. Just a little something to cheer us up… :)</p>

<p>So, here’s the “plan”… mixing watercolor paint on our drawing paper. Just like a rainbow.</p>

<p>Easy peasy.</p>

</div>

<p>It must be an awful plan, though, ‘cos the little guy quickly took over all the brushes. He then started splattering paint everywhere and making a few random brush-strokes.</p>

</div>

<p>I watched in horror as he poured whatever left in the palette on the drawing paper. It was watercolor paint, mind you. Not our usual washable paint.The only thing that kept me from screaming at him to stop was because I had my trusted wet tissue near… ^_^”</p>

<p>I’m not sure whether it was a fair deal, though. He got his 10 minutes of fun, while I nearly went berserk trying to keep everything stain-free.</p>

<p>But hey, I’ve just checked again. We really managed to leave no mess behind… :)</p>

<p>Best of all, the little guy’s artwork looked great after it dries.</p>

</div>

<p>We probably should do this again next time.</p>

<p>Yeah, I know. I should quickly get that new set of washable paint out from the storeroom first… :P</p>
