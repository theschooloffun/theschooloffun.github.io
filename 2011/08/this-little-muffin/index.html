        <p>A friend of mine recently asked if I enjoy parenthood. I chuckled before I answered, “Now that he is such a cutie, yes… I do.”</p>

<p>Frankly, I would probably answer with a simple “Yes!” if only I didn’t remember how the little guy had turned the house upside down just the day before. Or how he could say “No!” even as fast as I could finish my sentence, no matter what I requested him to do a little while earlier. I dare not even say I would answer the same way if my friend asked me that question later that day when I felt like shouting at the little guy for what he had done … <em>_I shall spare you the gory detail… I don’t want to end up scaring people into not having children… :P_</em></p>

<p>The truth is, with kids at home, there certainly are those <em>tough</em> days. Geee, who am I kidding, even without kids, there certainly are tough days. There may be unreasonable deadlines to meet, a series of late-night work, spam calls to deal with, the great kitchen flood and a broken pipe to fix, the fire in the kitchen with real opportunity to use real fire extinguisher, two lizards deciding to rest in peace in the sink for you to pick up and throw … you name it! <em>_Don’t worry I’ve experienced all of the above… in any combination… and I survive…_ :) __</em> Seriously, at times, even being a housewife could be more nerve-wracking than joining that famous show Fear Factor!</p>

<p>With kids at home, there would be even more variations to the kinds of “tough days”. Such as the terrible twos. I used to think that the terrible twos are for the two-year-old only. Not for the three-year-old or four-year-old and above. And since the little guy started to have it earlier, I expected (or should I now say, I prayed) that it would end earlier…^<em>^” Now I start to have a feeling that this stage is here to stay, and may even reach its peak during the teen years… *-_gasp- what am I getting myself into?!</em>*</p>

<p>Of course, I couldn’t just blame it on the little guy for all those tough days with him. For all I know, it could be just the impatient side of me. Yeah, I guess my patience level is just as bad as this two-year-old’s … :P</p>

<p>Anyway, in the effort to whip my patience into shape and sidestep the stress, I decided to bake something. I guess that recent advertisement tagline that goes something like “Stressed is Desserts spelled backwards” <em>_eeks… now I can’t even remember where I saw it!_</em> somehow sticks around in my head and prompted me to bake some banana muffins.</p>

<p>It turned out that the little guy, too, got to learn to burn off his unbridled energy indoor from this baking exercise.</p>

<p>Even if it was just for a short while…. He got busy eating the chocolate chips later on… &gt;_&lt;</p>

<p>But awww… if only you were here to enjoy the smell of freshly baked muffins! A combination of banana and chocolate… mmm… they just smelled heavenly and even the smell really helped one to relax! Let alone eating those freshly-baked muffins…</p>

<p>Watching the little guy enjoying every bite really made me want to tuck into one myself…</p>

<p>And those empty muffin cases… don’t they just beckon me to bake another batch!!</p>

<p>Okie… ask me that question about parenthood again. This time I’ll give you my resounding “Yes!”… :)</p>

<p>What about the terrible twos, you ask? Bring it on! ;)</p>
