        <p>I never understand why balloons deserve so much attention. Each time the little guy sees a person carrying balloons, he would beg me to get one for him…</p>

<p>In fact, I don’t understand why most kids like balloons. I’m trying hard to recall if I like balloons as much as the little guy does when I was his age. I may not like the popping sound, but I don’t think I have a balloon phobia. I’m afraid even my parents would beg to differ if you ask them why I dislike balloons. I probably grew up like any other kids, with lots of balloons to blow and pop. But… seriously, looking back, I always wonder how I managed to pull through the many years of balloon-popping games in school, birthday parties and freshmen orientation. Why would you blow a balloon up only to pop it later on?! I still couldn’t see the fun in it…</p>

<p>Anyway, now that I have a child of my own, it gets easier to pinpoint why I dislike balloons. I don’t fancy carrying a balloon when I have lots of other things to carry, including the little guy himself… :P Nevertheless, countless balloons went home with us every now and then. They “decorate” the neglected corners of our home, especially since the little guy’s puppy love to it usually only lasts for a day or two.</p>

<p>After a couple of days, these balloons would usually shrink. Ha! That’s gonna be the time I could put them into the dustbin… &gt;:P</p>

<p>But, wait a minute, here is what happened when I recently decided to give one balloon another chance… :)</p>

<p><strong>What we had</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>balloon</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>paint</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>yarn</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>drawing paper</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>water</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Let the Fun Begin!</strong></p>

<p>The little guy gladly helped me to fill the balloon with water. In fact, if I could just stop nagging him, he would probably end up with one big water bomb… :P</p>

<p>After helping him to tie it with a yarn, I showed him how to bounce the balloon around, leaving colorful marks behind.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Bounce! Bounce!</p>
    
</div>

<p>Now, that was really fun, I tell ya! Really, really addictive! I even had to fight for my chance to paint once the little guy got the hang of it.</p>

<p>While waiting for the paintings to dry, I pierced the water balloon and let the little guy enjoy squirting the water around.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Too Little to Last</p>
    
</div>

<p>The squirting fun, of course, didn’t last long. The little guy also didn’t have the patience to wait for the paintings to dry. So, he started to bring his cars and all sort of things to the paintings.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Vroom... Vroom...</p>
    
</div>

<p>And that was how we got all those funny tracks on our paintings… :P</p>
