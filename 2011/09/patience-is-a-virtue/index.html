<p>Especially when the above happened not long after I mopped the floor….^_^” Yup, the floor was nicely clean and dry before the little guy began his “water project”. Seriously, now that he knows how to get a bucket of water on his own, the weather forecasts should probably include regular flood alerts.</p>

<p>Thankfully, in the end, I managed to keep my cool. I let him play peacefully and when he had given me the confirmation that he was no longer interested to play, I started to mop the floor (again!).</p>

<p>Of course, while I cleaned up, I had to make sure he would not take sudden interest in getting another bucket of water. I looked around for something interesting that could occupy him for at least for 5 - 10 minutes. Check out what we got.</p>

<p>Pompoms, a tweezer and a muffin tin! Perfect!</p>

<p>As soon as he learned how to use the tweezer, he carefully picked each pompom and placed it inside the muffin tin.</p>

<p>Frankly, at first I was impressed with his patience and focus. Well, I should… we’re talking about a toddler who could barely sit still for even a minute here!</p>

<p>For a while, the thought of patting myself on the back crossed my mind. Hey… maybe I finally managed to turn this little guy into a patient mini-me…0:)</p>

<p>Then… he poured out the whole container of pompoms into the muffin tin, clapped for himself and cheekily said “Well done!”</p>

<p>Yup, that’s it. End of story.</p>

<p>Phewww… at least, the floor was already clean and dry by then…</p>
