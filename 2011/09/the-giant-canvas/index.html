        <p>Lately, I’ve started to sense that our desktop has something against me. Somehow, each time it decided to break down, it just had to be when I was about to use or when I was using it…. :S Geee… as if I’ve been abusing it!! &gt;_&lt;</p>

<p>Of course, every cloud has a silver lining, doesn’t it? As I become more reluctant to switch on the computer, we’ve been spending a great deal of time outdoor, be it in the playground or simply, outside our place… away from the technology. Yup, with a giant canvas outside, it just gets difficult to get bored “at home”… :)</p>

<p>It’s been pretty windy, too, lately. So, it didn’t take long for our paintings to disappear, giving us a fresh start each time. Or, perhaps it wasn’t such a good thing after all since I quickly had to take a picture?!</p>

<p>And here’s the good news: my plants have been well taken care of these days! :P</p>

<p>Hey… wait a minute! I’ve got another good news!</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes have passed and this desktop still hasn’t given up on me. Yipeeee… That’s one good sign! <em>_crossing fingers_</em></p>
