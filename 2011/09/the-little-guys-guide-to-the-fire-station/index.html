        <p>We all need a break. Yup, even if you’re a play-at-home mom like me. As much I love staying at home (let alone playing at home!), I do yearn for those good old days when I could just think of a place and make a dash for that place, within that 24-hour period.</p>

<p>I must admit, though, that this kind of so-called “wild imagination” usually takes place when the little guy is at his naughtiest… :P During those days, I would gladly reply “Yes!” to all kind of invitation to get out of the house, especially play dates. Yup, especially play dates.</p>

<p>So, when a friend of mine proposed a plan to bring the kids to the fire station on an early Saturday morning, I honestly felt like jumping for joy. Never mind if that means we had to be there by 930 AM (Most fire stations in Singapore are open to public every Saturday between 9 and 11 AM only) on such a wonderful weekend when the little guy only woke up at about 740 AM (The little guy rarely wakes up that late on a Saturday. He is the ultimate morning person when it comes to Saturdays!)… Never mind if the bed and the blanket seemed to beckon us to return thanks to all those late-night movies and the wonderful weather that morning…</p>

<p>In fact, I was so excited to go that instead of reaching there by 930 AM, we reached there by 915 AM. Of course, I didn’t expect much crowd on such an early Saturday morning… and gee was I surprised to see dozens of kids swarming around the fire trucks! They didn’t seem like they have just started their activities, so I guess they must have come even waaay earlier than us! <em>_clap, clap_</em></p>

<p>As we waited for our friends to reach, we just couldn’t help not to tail those kids and eavesdrop on the “guided tour”. It turned out that it was a right decision after all. Two of the above Red Rhino went out for duty not long after we tried something that I chose to call “water canon” (I know, shame on me… I forgot to ask what it is actually called). The early birds catch the worms, huh?! :)</p>

<p>Once our friends reached the fire station, we took turn to try boarding the ladder-platform on the enormous fire engine. I’m actually not so sure if the little guy really enjoyed it, even though he kept telling me that he had fun. You see, he didn’t jump excitedly like what he usually does. But then again, at that height, maybe I should be grateful he didn’t attempt to jump around or sway the platform…</p>

<p>It got more exciting as the firefighters brought the kids to try the hose. Seriously, I was impressed with how these firefighters went out of their ways to make these kids laugh! Now, every time I ask the little guy about his trip to the fire station, he would grin and start babbling about how he sprayed the water… :) He would even show me how he would hold and aim the hose.</p>

<p>Yeah.. who wouldn’t love such an exciting water play! The kids simply had a great time on their own running around and splashing in the deep puddles. Water flew everywhere, so it was obvious that we, the mommies, were just waiting at the side…. :P</p>

<p>Of course our trip to the fire station wouldn’t be complete if we didn’t get to see the real fireman’s pole. We listened to one of the firefighters as he explained how the pole helps them to descend to the ground floor faster than by using a staircase. The kids, obviously, didn’t care about the details. Yet, the moment, the kind firefighter offered to give us a demonstration, the kids dutifully lined up and watched in awe. I  bet that was the highlight for them!</p>

<p>I must say, the kids weren’t the only ones who got to learn something from the visit. The hospitable firefighters showed a genuine interest in answering all our questions and sharing their knowledge and experience with us, the adults in our group. Kudos to these amazing people!</p>
