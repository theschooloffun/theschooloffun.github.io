        <p>The weather has been pretty chaotic the last few days. There has been too much rain in most mornings and it gets unusually hot in the afternoon… &gt;_&lt; It certainly gives us the best reason to simply stay indoor as much as we could.</p>

<p>No, no… don’t get me wrong. I’m not complaining. In fact, the weather has inspired us to get crafty… <em>_wink, wink_</em></p>

<p>And speaking about getting crafty, wanna guess what makes the perfect accompaniment to a rainy day’s craft session?</p>

<p>Toilet paper rolls. Lots … and lots of them…. <em>_grinz_</em></p>

<p><strong>What we had</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>yarn</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>toilet paper rolls (or kitchen towel rolls)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>glue</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>drinking straws</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>hole puncher</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>twist tie (or any kid-friendly metal wire you could get)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Let the Fun Begin!</strong></p>

<p>We decided to create a more sophisticated version of the <a href="http://theschooloffun.com/2011/05/09/the-falling-fish/">falling fish</a>.</p>

<p>First, we made the cable cars out of toilet paper rolls. While the little guy would really love to help me with the hole puncher and the twist tie, all he could do was to help me glue and decorate the cable cars.</p>

<p>I must warn you here, making the cable cars’ cords proved to be quite … uhm, tricky.The toilet paper rolls were obviously thicker than I thought and too much for my hole puncher to handle. In the end, I just anyhow poked 2 small holes in each roll.</p>

<p>Next, I threaded the metal wire through one hole, tied a knot on the straw (placed above the cable car), and finally tied the other end of the wire to the other hole.</p>

<p>But, hey, that was it. All you need to do next is to thread the yarn through the straw, find the best place to operate your cable cars and your cable cars will be fully operational in no time… :)</p>

<p>The little guy happily took the role as the cable car operator for the day.</p>

<p>Hmm… maybe next time I should prepare some tickets for him to issue to his passengers before they could board the cable cars.. :P That would be very interesting!</p>
