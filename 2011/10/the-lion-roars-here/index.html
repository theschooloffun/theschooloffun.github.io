        <p>To “celebrate” <a href="http://www.marinabaysands.com/Singapore-Entertainment/Shows/The-Lion-King/">The Lion King</a>’s Last Roar on 30th October, we decided to <em>finally</em> go for it last week. Thankfully, it wasn’t that difficult to get nice seats.</p>

<p>We certainly wouldn’t want to miss the boat, but earlier, we thought the show would run for at least a year… :P Nearly each month, a friend would tell us how awesome the show was, but we kept telling ourselves we could always watch it next time. We really thought the show was here to stay!</p>

<p>To our surprise, even though we booked our tickets in a rush, we got ourselves a free seat upgrade. And here’s the best part: we could bring the little guy for free, too! Don’t you just love being a 2-year-old!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we were rather worried at first. What if nobody believed us that our little guy really is a 2-year-old? What if he got so noisy that everybody stared at us? What if he kept moving around the aisle? It turned out that we worried for nothing. None of the above happened. The little guy was the sweetest boy inside the theater where dozens of other kids (big and small) were also around.</p>

<p>He had a jolly good time and he even picked up some moves from the musical… :P</p>

<p>He would also roar each time he sees the logo. Now, that calls for an artwork to make… :)</p>

<p><strong>What we had</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>clothes’ peg</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>black paint</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>marker</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>glue</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>drawing paper</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Let the Fun Begin!</strong></p>

<p>First, I drew the lion’s face on a drawing paper, using a marker.</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/10/269_lion_01.jpg" title="The Face" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/10/269_lion_01.jpg" alt="The Face" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">The Face</p>
    
</div>

<p>Next, we dipped the clothes peg on black paint and started stamping on another piece of drawing paper.</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/10/269_lion_02.jpg" title="Stamp!" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/10/269_lion_02.jpg" alt="Stamp!" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Stamp!</p>
    
</div>

<p>The little guy seemed to be pretty generous with the paint. He even asked me for a second helping before he finished half of the lion’s mane!</p>

<p>Once the paint dried, I helped him cut the face and let him handle the sticking part.</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2011/10/269_lion_03.jpg" title="Roarrr!" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/10/269_lion_03.jpg" alt="Roarrr!" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Roarrr!</p>
    
</div>

<p>And yup, he went “Roarrr!” when we were done! :)</p>
