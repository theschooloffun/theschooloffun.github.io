        <p>Although the little guy generally has nothing against brushing his teeth, there are times when he just doesn’t feel like letting me brush his teeth. While at good times he may grab the toothbrush from my hand and brush his teeth himself, at “tough” times he would just clamp his mouth shut and push the toothbrush away.</p>

<p>In an effort to enforce consistency, I decided to turn foam box padding and a small cardboard box into… well, a mouth full of teeth… :)</p>

<p>The little guy diligently helped me stick the “teeth” onto the box.</p>

<p>And once we finished putting all the teeth, it did look like a great toy. At least, at first…</p>

<p>We could sing “The mouth in the house goes open and shut… open and shut…open and shut… The mouth in the house goes open and shut, all day long” to the tune of “The Wheel on the Bus” with it.</p>

<p>And we could, of course, brush them clean.. :D</p>

<p>Sadly, it didn’t pass the 10-minute test. The little guy simply lost interest in it after two rounds of “The Mouth in the House” and one round of tooth brushing.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if that means he had just crossed dentistry out of his list. It’s too early to judge… Perhaps it’s just not the right kind of toy for his age…</p>

<p>One thing for sure, if he’s ever going to be a dentist, I would think twice before I let him do anything with my teeth. I know I have to play the role of a supportive mom here… but, really, I still do love my teeth very much. And this little guy…He just seemed so happy plucking all those teeth inside that box! One. By. One …&gt;_&lt;</p>
