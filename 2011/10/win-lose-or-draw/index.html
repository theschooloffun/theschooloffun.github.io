<p>I think I’ve gradually become one of them. A member of Proud-Mommies-who-post-their-proud-mommy-moments-online club….<em>_gasp_</em></p>

<p>Sorry… but I really can’t help it.</p>

<p>Finally, the little guy’s first meaningful scribble! For the first time ever, we both could agree on what he actually drew: smiley face! And to think that he drew it all by himself! I wasn’t even there when he took out the marker and started scribbling <em>_yup, thankfully, he didn’t scribble on anything else…_</em>. When he showed me his masterpiece and said, “Mommy… Smile, Mommy!”, I just couldn’t help not to hug him… :’)</p>

<p>He’s started scribbling more than a year ago. Circles, by far, seem to be his favorite. He would try to tell me about what he drew, but I could rarely see the story behind each random scribble on my own.</p>

<p>Wait a minute… seriously, now that gets me thinking… Is this really his milestone (for being able to draw meaningful symbols) or is this actually mine (for finally being able to decipher his random scribbles)? Hee hee… :P</p>

<p>Whichever it is, here’s to many more meaningful pictures… :)</p>
