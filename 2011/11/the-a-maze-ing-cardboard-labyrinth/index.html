        <p>Once again, cleaning the storeroom proves to be such an exciting affair. While it usually ends with terrible allergic reactions that last for the rest of the day, it never fails to bring out new treasures as well as old… :)</p>

<p>Last week, during the long weekend, in our unspoken effort to postpone doing anything that was written in our to-do list, my husband and I ended up cleaning the storeroom… <em>_grinz_</em></p>

<p>Sure, we threw lots of things away. And all of sudden, we find ourselves having quite a number of empty cardboard boxes. Yup, my kind of treasures…:D Yipee!</p>

<p>You see, I’ve always wanted to get a wooden labyrinth puzzle for the little guy. As the youngest among most of my cousins, I inherited quite a fair bit of old toys when I grew up. One of them was a wooden labyrinth puzzle. The objective is simple: move the ball from one end to the other, using two knobs, while avoiding the holes along the way.</p>

<p>Fun, I know. But, frankly, I never get to accomplish that objective. Hee hee… :P</p>

<p>Still, I remember how it fascinated me. I bet the little guy would be just as fascinated as me. So, I was determined to make one for him with one of the newly-found cardboard boxes.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Look, no hole!</p>
    
</div>

<p>To start off, I made a simple one. A very simple one, in fact. No hole. Just a simple maze. Instead of a metal ball, I put a small, red bell. I showed the little guy how he could “shake” the box to move the bell and hear it jingling. Yet, he chose to use his fingers to move the bell instead…^_^”</p>

<p>But once the message sunk in, he asked me for lots and lots of beads… :P</p>

    <p class="image-caption">More beads!</p>
    
</div>

<p>Oh yeah… it certainly passes the 10-minute test… :P</p>

<p>Especially as soon as he figured out that he could also use it for another purpose… :P</p>
