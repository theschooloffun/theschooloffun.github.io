        <p>Seriously, I don’t know what has got into me when I gave the nod to my husband as he happily filled up a form for me that night.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.marina-bay.sg/Funfinder/event/view/balloon-wonderland?category=sports-and-recreation&amp;theme=">Balloon Wonderland</a>, he told me.</p>

<p>Uh-huh… okie… sounds … well, exciting.</p>

<p>I know I should have been more careful, especially <a href="http://theschooloffun.com/2011/09/28/balloon-attack/">considering my feelings towards balloons</a>… But somehow, it didn’t cross my mind that we were actually filling the forms to register ourselves as volunteers. It didn’t cross my mind that we would be twisting and sculpting balloons. Oh yeah, notice the plural form of balloon there? We’ll be sculpting lots and lots of balloons… &gt;_&lt;</p>

<p>So, on Saturday morning, as I dragged my feet to attend the volunteer workshop, I started imagining the screeching sound and it made me cringe… I couldn’t believe my ears when my husband mentioned how he would be counting on me to pick up the knowledge as he couldn’t stand the screeching sound. He was simply lucky I didn’t smack him right then, right there … :P</p>

<p>Anyway, the little guy tagged along and he was obviously the happiest chap there. There must be euphoric effects caused by seeing so many colorful balloons.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, my husband and I somehow managed to pull through.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Octopus: Our Heaviest Catch</p>
    
</div>

<p>The octopus is the easiest to make. The only downside to it is just that it’s huge. It was great that they taught us to make an octopus first. Otherwise, half of the class would probably have made their way out by then… :P</p>

    <a href="/uploads/2011/11/280_balloon_03.jpg" title="Caught a Fish!" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/11/280_balloon_03.jpg" alt="Caught a Fish!" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Caught a Fish!</p>
    
</div>

<p>We then learned how to make a fish. Although my husband said I made the best pouting lips, I could never really see the fish in my fish. They all just look like dragons to me… &gt;_&lt;</p>

<p>Here, to support my proposition, I made a red one.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">It's a Dragon, I Tell Ya!</p>
    
</div>

<p>Yup, it’s a dragon. I knew it!</p>

    <a href="/uploads/2011/11/280_balloon_04.jpg" title="Flower: Definitely Not Mine" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2011/11/280_balloon_04.jpg" alt="Flower: Definitely Not Mine" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Flower: Definitely Not Mine</p>
    
</div>

<p>Next, we learned how to make a (supposedly) simple flower bracelet. I still don’t understand the “simple” part in that statement. Well, it does look simple. Yet, somehow, it isn’t that simple to make! Trust me, I popped too many balloons trying to make one simple flower bracelet! &gt;_&lt; To add insult to injury, it didn’t even look like a flower! Eeekssss…! That yellow flower you see, it was my husband’s…</p>

<p>Oh well, at least my octopus looks nice…:)</p>

</div>

<p>Oh, don’t worry, I’m not a quitter. You would still find me at the Balloon Wonderland next Saturday… unless it rains, of course… :P Spot me among the other volunteers and I promise I’ll make you one giant octopus. Just please.. don’t ask me for a fish or, worse, a flower. You’ll probably just get one big sausage instead… aka, I’ll let you do your own twisting… :P</p>
