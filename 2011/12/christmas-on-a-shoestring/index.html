        <p>Yup, we’ve been away from the computer for the longest time ever. We (literally) closed our eyes and the first half of the December was gone. Forget about listening to the Christmas carols, the little guy had been pretty strict about the playlist whenever we were in his room. Forget about the Christmas shopping list, we barely made it to the door.</p>

<p>Sad. I know. All three of us had been taking turns being sick. First, daddy had a cough. The longest and worst cough ever, but for weeks, we somehow survived without being infected. Yet, 3 weeks later, the little guy was down with fever and cough. And that was it. I had my turn just 2 days after! I guess it was just hard not to get infected when he made sure I stayed next to him to give him his dose of bear hugs. All through the day. And night… &gt;_&lt; Yup, all while he breathed and coughed right under my nose.</p>

<p>So, for more than a week, we just grew too familiar with the bed. Sure, he turned into a cheeky monkey after he took his medicine. But the moment the effect of the medicine wore out, he was back under the blanket. Poor guy, he was!</p>

<p>We did, however, manage to do a bit of Christmas decoration. A Christmas tree… :) Not a real one yet, though. Until I’m confident that he has passed that age of a climbing monkey, I don’t think I would bring home any of those Christmas trees that I have always wanted to get.</p>

<p>Five minutes and we were ready to hit the bed again! That fast and easy… :P</p>

<p>We’ll tie some nice bows and put up some colorful baubles once we feel much better… :) Just you wait… I’ve started to feel the Christmas spirit… ;)</p>
