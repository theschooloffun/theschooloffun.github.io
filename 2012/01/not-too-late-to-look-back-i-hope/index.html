        <p>Awesome.</p>

<p>I still remember my password…<em>_grinz_</em></p>

<p>Oh, hi there.. :) It feels great to be back online after such a long time. Let’s just say we have just had a different kind of December and January. I won’t say the last 2 months weren’t manageable… they’re just well, different.</p>

<p>Never before had we spent nearly 3 weeks passing around germs among the three of us. When the flu bugs hit us badly in December … crash, boom, bang… just like that… wow…, it’s just hard not to say to ourselves, “So much for thinking that we’ve been leading a pretty healthy lifestyle!” I know I’ve given up on making New Year’s resolutions, but I guess -  whatever I decide to call the list - leading a healthier lifestyle should be on top of our list for this year… :P</p>

<p>Thankfully, we managed to end the year 2011 on a good note. We went for a good, relaxing holiday to our hometown. Everything was just great!</p>

<p>And then… all three of us took turn to fall sick again. Ha! :P</p>

<p>Oh well… anyway, I thought I should include a more cheerful side note here…Yup, just a little something that I have been noticing… :)</p>

<p>If there really should be a silver lining for every cloud, I must say that the recent bout of flu has unveiled some new skills. The fact that he didn’t really have the appetite nor the energy to run around taught him to sit still and learn to concentrate.</p>

<p>This magic painting book was one of the things that finally caught his interest when he was very sick. He completed this whole book of watercolor painting in one afternoon! Totally exceeded his usual 15-minute attention span… :P</p>

<p>He also finally gave coloring a chance. He never likes to color within the lines. He’d rather draw. The more I encourage him to color within the lines, the more random the scribbles he makes… :P You see, he is never the “do-as-you-say” type. Trust me, there was even a period when we actually had to tell him not to smile when we wanted him to smile for the camera… ^_^” (A trick that has always seemed to work to make him giggle!) So, I’ve stopped asking him to color within the lines. And all of sudden, when I wasn’t around, he colored a picture I drew for him earlier…</p>

<p>He has also perfected his skill at making <a href="http://theschooloffun.com/2011/10/12/win-lose-or-draw/">a smiley face</a>… :) They now come with hair, eyebrow and beard. I wonder if he was inspired by Santa Claus… :p</p>

<p>And finally, he made his first attempt to build something meaningful (other than those tall towers) on his own with Lego bricks. Something that, I believe, he would not have been able to do if he didn’t get to perfect his concentration skill as he was down with flu…:)</p>

<p>Indeed, something to be grateful about. Still… no more flu bugs, please… :S</p>
