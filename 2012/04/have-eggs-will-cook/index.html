        <p>Don’t get me wrong.</p>

<p>I love our new kitchen. I do want to make sure it is durable and have no intention to prove how much abuse it could withstand.</p>

<p>Yet, as much as I want to keep it spick and span, everyone in the family seems to want to try using it… &gt;_&lt; Yup, including the little guy.</p>

<p>Apparently, he got tired of his <a href="http://theschooloffun.com/2012/04/03/the-cooking-little-guy/">toy kitchen</a>. And everything that mommy does in the kitchen always looks … oh-more-interesting-than-anything-else!</p>

<p>So, this morning, he begged me to let him cook egg. Till now, I couldn’t figure out why I said yes in the first place… :S Just think of how much adult supervision I need to put to ensure that everything stays intact! Eeeksss… and to think that the new kitchen is not even a month old!</p>

<p>Obviously, accidents are bound to happen. Even during the first step: breaking the egg into a bowl.</p>

<p>The good news is the little guy has been observant enough to remember exactly how I usually break eggs. The bad news is he just doesn’t like to wait. He refused to wait until I put down my camera and help him with the egg. My heart sank as I watched how the egg spilled all over the table and floor… ^_^”</p>

<p>Oh well, at least he did manage to put a teeny-weeny drop of egg into the bowl.</p>

<p>We took another egg. This time round, I made sure I held his hands as he broke it into the bowl.</p>

<p>He proceeded with the whisking part while I heated the frying pan.</p>

<p>He seemed to be more careful now that he knows how sticky eggs are… :P</p>

<p>And finally, it was time to add the beaten egg into the frying pan… his favorite part! :) If only you could see how excited he got as he scraped the egg from side to side… :P</p>

<p>And hey… he actually listened to me and took the basic safety precaution not to touch the hot surfaces.. :)</p>

<p>To end this entry on a sweet note: The kitchen survives… yayyy… :) And somebody ate a hearty breakfast this morning… ;)</p>

<p>So, will we do this again next time? Uhmmm… let me think about it… ^_^”</p>
