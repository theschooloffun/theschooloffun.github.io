        <p>And so… we are officially no longer kitchen-less. It still feels like a dream that we could finally do something to the “sinking” sink (“sinking” may not be the right term, but it’s just hard not to think of Titanic when seeing the old sink…) before it breaks into two and collapses. The fact that the hob is no more than a mere decoration for the time being (no gas.. duh!) also puts a question mark to whether we’re just seeing things or that really <em>is</em> our dream kitchen … ^_^”</p>

<p>Anyway, I foresee that the damage control (read: cleaning and organizing the new kitchen while tackling that mountain of laundry that has developed over the week…. eeks!) would take longer time when compared to the time needed to build the kitchen… :S Sure, the sweet little guy never fails to offer his help. Yet, more often than not, I end up with more backache when he’s helping… :P</p>

<p>I thought of building him a little kitchen from cardboard so that he could get busy cleaning and organizing his own kitchen while I do my work. Yet, as both my husband and I have been burning the candle at both ends these days, it’s just hard to find the time to build such thing without having the little guy around.</p>

<p>Then, I saw the Styrofoam that used to hold the new hob inside the box. Yipee.. :) Thanks to whoever has forgotten to throw it, I don’t need to build a kitchen for the little guy from scratch!</p>

<p>It didn’t take long for the little guy to fall in love with his new hob. He even put his toy trains inside, pretending that they are the ignition knobs.</p>

<p>Soon enough, he started to try out different pots and pans…</p>

<p>Of course, as his one and only customer, I got to order whatever I like … <em>_grinz_</em></p>

<p>And when the kitchen is close for a short nap time, it could somehow morph into a … train track cum car park… :P</p>

<p>Now… excuse me while I go and stack those containers again. I’ll be at the kitchen… ;)</p>
