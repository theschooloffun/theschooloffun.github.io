        <p>Suddenly, we find ourselves having lots of wooden clothes pegs.</p>

<p>They surely make great musical instruments, as the little guy found out when he started his very own percussion play concert by banging away these pegs.</p>

<p>Still, they look… well, plain.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Plain Jane</p>
    
</div>

<p>So we thought we should put some colors on.</p>

<p>All we need was a little bit of red.</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2012/05/303_avengers_02.jpg" title="Red Paint" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2012/05/303_avengers_02.jpg" alt="Red Paint" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Red Paint</p>
    
</div>

<p>… and a little bit of blue…</p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2012/05/303_avengers_011.jpg" title="Blue Paint" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2012/05/303_avengers_011.jpg" alt="Blue Paint" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Blue Paint</p>
    
</div>

<p>But then, ample, uninterrupted time to work on the detail changed everything … ;) I turned the pegs into something else while the little guy was fast asleep… :P</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2012/05/303_avengers_03.jpg" title="The Iron Man" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2012/05/303_avengers_03.jpg" alt="The Iron Man" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">The Iron Man</p>

<div class="image-wrapper">
    <a href="/uploads/2012/05/303_avengers_04.jpg" title="Captain America" target="_blank"><img src="/uploads/2012/05/303_avengers_04.jpg" alt="Captain America" /></a>
    
    <p class="image-caption">Captain America</p>
    
</div>

<p>For the next few days, these two heroes became the little guy’s favorite companions. Everywhere he went, he made sure he brought them along. And <em>I</em> made sure he brought them home… hee hee… For days, they offered instant entertainment on the go for both us as we made a couple of silly stories with them. Never mind even if our Iron Man looks more like a red ninja… or if our Captain America looks like a clown in blue tights… they are still <em>the</em> superheroes to the little guy… :)</p>

<p>Geee… now I feel like making the Incredible Hulk, too… :P</p>

<p>Anyway, on a side note, the little guy has made the definition of a “superhero” less complicated. Apparently, in his dictionary, you don’t need to wear those tights or have superpower to be one.</p>

<p>In one of those recent awesome moments, as I held his hand when crossing roads together, he gave me his sweetest smile and told me, “Thank you, mommy, for stopping the bus for me…”</p>

<p>And that’s it! He has certainly made his mommy feel like one of those superheroes! Awww… :’)</p>
