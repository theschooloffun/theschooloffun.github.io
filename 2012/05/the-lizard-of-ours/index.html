        <p>We have always had lizards on our walls. They come and go like nobody’s business and for years, the little guy never seemed to care.</p>

<p>Then, one day, one little lizard decided to jump from the high to the ground not far from where the little guy stood. No doubt it startled him.</p>

<p>It’s been a love-hate relationship ever since. The little guy could be both excited and scared even when he was a few meters away from a lizard. He loves it when I sing about lizards. He also loves teasing people, saying that there is a lizard just right behind them when there isn’t any. Yet, the sight of a real lizard on the wall could send him jumping out of his seat!</p>

<p>It’s probably too early to say whether he has a real phobia. Still, since he shows such an “interest”, I thought it wouldn’t hurt to make something related to lizards… :P</p>

<p><strong>What we had</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>construction paper (we used maroon)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>scissors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>clear tapes or glue</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>chopsticks</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Let the Fun Begin!</strong></p>

<p>First, I drew on the construction paper while the little guy took a nap. I tried not to do most of the cutting, as I thought he would appreciate making his own lizard more… :)</p>

<p>Anyway, I left the materials on the table, positioning them in such a way to give a clear hint of what it was going to be.</p>

</div>

<p>I knew it worked when I heard the little guy shrieking happily, “Mommy, Mommy… It’s lizard, mommy!” He then pestered me, telling me he wanted to make it right away. On his own… :P</p>

<p>And so I taught him how to make accordion folds for the lizard’s body. Since he was so excited about this whole lizard-y thing, I really had his full attention. Ha! :P</p>

<p>Although I had to guide him as he cut the head, he managed to carefully cut the tail without getting frustrated.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Snip snip snip...</p>
    
</div>

<p>Next, as he helped me arrange and keep all the parts close to each other, I used clear tapes to stick them up. Certainly faster and less messy than using glue… :)</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Stick stick stick...</p>
    
</div>

<p>Lastly, we used clear tapes to fix the chopsticks near the limbs.</p>

<p>That day, the little guy treated me to an afternoon of silly games and stories on lizards as well as hilarious lizard dance performances. Hee hee… not bad for somebody with such a love-hate relationship with lizards… :P</p>
