<p>Yup, the little guy has recently assumed the role of big brother to his new baby brother, a role that he, so far, wears like a badge of honor.. :) He makes sure his mommy feeds his little brother each time he cries. He asks his mommy again and again to check the little brother’s diaper and rushes to get the wet wipes when it’s time to change the diaper. He loves it when the little brother is put on his arms and can’t stop giving his little brother kisses.</p>

<p>I know, they’ve been very sweet… :’)</p>

<p>With the new addition to the family, we suddenly find the little guy no longer … uhm, “little”. So, the little guy is now officially <strong>the big brother</strong>.</p>

<p>Hm… come to think of it, it is an understatement to say only “somebody” has been busy lately. In fact, <em>everybody</em>’s been busy! Taking care of a baby for the second time may seem such a breeze. Yet, put in a 3-year-old doting big brother in the equation and it gets even harder to hit the jackpot… :P Nope, I won’t bore you with the details… :) They make a great learning experience for all of us, anyway… ;)</p>

<p>And oh.. do bear with us as we adjust to having a new baby at home… ;)</p>
