<p>We’ve been so busy soaking up all the goodness our 3-month-new bundle of joy could offer that blogging has sunk low on my priority list.</p>

<p>And indeed the little brother really has a lot to offer. Never mind if he’s like a ticking time bomb, asking for milk every 3 hours or so. And even if he loves to announce it to all the neighbors in our block when he’s hungry! All it takes is just his sweet smile and it’s all good again… :)</p>

<p>And how does the big brother cope with all this, you ask?</p>

<p>Well, he’s been an amazing big brother! Well, of course there were times when I hope he could do better, but I guess I just have to adjust my expectation. He’s only 3 years old, after all. Just like me, he’s learning to adapt. If I were to watch my mom breastfeeding my little brother again and again, I’ll probably grow as restless as him!</p>

<p>Being a person who loves to plan ahead (ahem!), I did think of a plan on how to occupy the big brother while his mommy is busy with the little brother. Even before the little brother made his grand entrance. I thought of preparing several boxes with different kinds of things to play with. So, each time I need to breastfeed the little brother, I could just pass one of these “surprise” boxes and let the big brother unravel the unknown.</p>

<p>Days passed and this wonderful plan remained… as a plan in my head… :P Once the little brother made his grand entrance, it gets difficult to sort out these boxes. Yup, how I wish I have the gene that is a blend of Martha Stewart and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_%28comics%29">The Flash</a>! I’ll tackle all the household chores (yes, including the mysterious multiplying laundry!) like a pro and <em>still</em> have plenty of time with the kiddos… :P</p>

<p>In the end, we resort to all the things that we already have and are scattered around the house. That’s how we <em>make</em> the time to do lots of fun stuff… ;) Since I often feel like the forgetful Dory these days, I thought I should just list some of them here. <em>**</em></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>**Pompom balls<br />
**</strong></li>

    <p class="image-caption">Blow!</p>
    
</div>

<p>Add in one or two drinking straws to the equation and you’ll get the recipe for an afternoon fun! Set the start and finish lines (you can use masking tape) and you could have a pompom blowing race. If you’re doing this while breastfeeding, just make sure the start and finish lines are not too far apart. Bending down while feeding a baby could be quite hazardous to your back and of course, your poor baby… :P Not confident that you could do such multitasking? Don’t worry, you’ll master it in no time! Hee hee…<br />
Alternatively, you could play air hockey using the same straws and pompom ball. You might need to trick your bigger child to catch the straying ball for you, though, if you want to minimize moving around… ;)</p>

<p>Mmm… marshmallow! Always fun to build .. and to eat! Just make sure you do this kind of activity after meal… :P</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Fly!</p>

<p>No, you don’t need to step out of the house to fly a kite. This is just the perfect kind of activity when it rains outside.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Paint</strong></li>

    <p class="image-caption">Drop!</p>
    
</div>

<p>Try painting with different kinds of tools: pipette, brush, toy cars, etc. Just be ready to clean the mess… :P Yup, certainly not for the faint-hearted!</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Blocks</strong></li>

<p>Come on… who doesn’t love building houses to put around the race track and let the cars ram into them? :P</p>

<p>Tracing a letter or any drawing with your fingers is just… therapeutic, I tell ya!</p>

  <li><strong>Paper (lots of them!), glue and scissors</strong></li>

    <p class="image-caption">Cut and Paste</p>
    
</div>

<p>Cutting paper is currently the big brother’s favorite. So, to make it more fun, I let him cut drawings I made and later on paste them back together. It may seem pointless, but it’s apparently fun… :P**<br />

    <p class="image-caption">Lace!</p>
    
</div>

<p>Oh, the joy of lacing! It’s so much fun now that the big brother has passed that pop-everything-in-the-mouth stage for quite some time.<br />
All I have to look out for now is that he doesn’t do anything funny with his creation, like putting it on the little brother’s head… ^_^”</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Books</strong><br />
Yup, read books! It’s like killing two birds with one stone. You get to read to both kids now! Economies of scale, indeed…<br />
Strangely, the easiest one is usually our last resort…^_^”</li>

<p>Okie, certainly not fresh new ideas, but I hope that will help you get started… ;) Do share some of your great ideas, too. The big brother (and the mommy!) would certainly love to try them out!</p>
