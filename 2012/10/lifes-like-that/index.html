<p>Blink … and these two are growing up very fast. Way. Too. Fast!</p>

<p>Sure… there are times when I wish away this seemingly endless period of taking care of an irritating preschooler and an irritated baby (oh yeah, they have mastered the skill of egging on each other!), but really… I cherish every minute (uhm, at least, most… &gt;_&lt;) of it.</p>

<p>I do miss my beauty sleep. Yup, it’s true when people say that you don’t miss the water till the well runs dry. I miss it a LOT, especially now that the two of them have shown that they could be devious enough in coming up with their own grand scheme to make me forget about this important thing called sleep (how else would you call it when your two kids could somehow schedule themselves to wake up 3 times at different hour throughout my supposedly 7-hour stretch of sleep?! Two boys, each woke up three times at different hour, and how long did I get to sleep? Go and do the math! They certainly cared not that I had a long list of things to do the next morning…:s)</p>

<p>Life gets even more interesting as they show me that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law">Murphy’s Law</a> is just.. well, common sense. The little brother would wake up and cry just right after I take out the cutting board to prepare dinner. I would have changed the bedsheets <strong>twice</strong> not long after the loaded washing machine changes from “Wash” to “Rinse” mode. I may have slowly mastered that multitasking skill, i.e. using one hand to do almost anything. But life is full of surprises, eh?! Just when I start that breastfeeding session, the big brother would ask me to open that container. Or to have his finger nails cut… Or to find that missing lego piece… &gt;_&lt;</p>

<p>We are probably wrong if we ever think that our mothers have no sense of humor. Once you become a mother, you will somehow build your sense of humor. Try counting the number of funny songs dedicated to pay tribute to mothers and you’ll know everyone agrees that sense of humor is an essential survival skill for us, mothers.</p>

<p>Oh, wait… you can’t remember any? No worries… Let me share some of my favorite:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wkc9-SvqfDM">Go Fish - The Mom Song</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXgoJ0f5EsQ&amp;feature=related">Mom Song (William Tell Overture)</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Uh oh… Here we go again. Listening to the songs has once again reminded me that we mothers hold the most important job in the world… :’) It’s our badge of honor. Something we should wear with pride.</p>

<p>Now.. if you could just show me the pause button… that would be great.. I want to enjoy this moment - every single moment - while it lasts… Don’t grow up too fast, kiddo!</p>
