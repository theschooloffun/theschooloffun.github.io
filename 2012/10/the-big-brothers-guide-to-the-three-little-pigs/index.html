        <p>It was all because of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Pets">Wonder Pets!</a></p>

<p>You see, we recently borrowed one of the DVD compilations from the library. It was all great at first. Then, it went on strike. It simply refused to show the part where the Wonder Pets save the three little pigs… :S We tried everything we could think of, but it just stopped there.</p>

<p>So, major meltdown? Well, not really. But the big brother kept pestering me about these funny looking pigs and their unknown fate. Day. And night. And day. And night…<em>_sigh</em> _</p>

<p>One morning, I decided to end the misery. Out came the colorful foam sheets and the ice cream sticks. It was time to get down to business.</p>

<p>First, we made the three little pigs.</p>

<p>Then, these pigs, of course, needed some houses, made of straw, wood and bricks.</p>

<p>Tadaa…three houses. We used ice cream sticks for the roof and colorful foam sheets for the yellow straw,  brown wood and blue (we ran out of red!) bricks. Not in the correct order (obviously, somebody had a different idea… :P), but that should be good enough for our storytelling session. We also used corn husks for the greenery, simply because those husks were lying on the table (I was shucking corn while the big brother built the houses).</p>

<p>The big brother also made his very own version of the big bad wolf.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">All Black!</p>

<p>And finally… the story unfolded… :P</p>

<p>I just love seeing the big brother’s facial expression as he retold the stories… :D He really seemed to have something against that big bad wolf. By the end of the day, when I couldn’t seem to find it anywhere, I thought he has thrown it into the bin. But when I asked him about it, he showed me where I could find it: he stuck it outside our gate… :P</p>

<p>Ahh… it’s good to be reminded that there’s always a big bad wolf lurking outside, isn’t it? :)</p>
