        <p>No, I don’t want the boys to remember these hands of mine as the hands that hold on tight to the broom, trying to clean every room of the house each and every day. Geez… I don’t even think they would notice whether I clean their room this morning… &gt;:p</p>

<p>No, I don’t want them to remember these hands as the hands that whip up a feast fit for a king, 3 times a day, 7 days a week. I doubt any of them remember what they have just had for breakfast… ^_^”</p>

<p>And no, I really don’t want them to remember these hands as the hands that hold the phone more often than their hands.Oh yeah… Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Seriously, I might one day be the one who would have to tolerate an overly occupied and completely distracted teenager and his irritating ringtones!</p>

<p>Let these hands of mine be the ones that help to hold the blocks while the boys build an odd lego structure.</p>

<p>Let these hands take pride as the ones that guide the boys’ hands as they roll the cookie dough or paint cardboard boxes.</p>

<p>Let my arms be the ones that give hugs on demand.</p>

<p>….</p>

<p>Yes, I want to be _that _loving mommy… :) Forget the broom, the ladle, and the phone… Let’s focus on what really matters.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Okie… now give me that pat on the back.</p>

<p>Be gentle, though… my back is still hurting… &gt;_&lt; …</p>

<p><em>_trying my best to accentuate the positive_</em></p>

<p><em>Note to self after winning 4D4N staycation (at home!!!) thanks to an awful back pain: You’re no longer the invincible. Hurriedly scooping up a 6-month-old from the cot bed while trying to attend to your 4-year-old would not do justice to your back! In fact, that could cost you some pain relief patches… :S</em></p>

<p><em>Note to self no.2: Check immediately when 2 boys get too quiet together… Yes, even when your back is hurting! Just because they often fight over everything, it doesn’t mean that they have no ability to work together… :s</em></p>
