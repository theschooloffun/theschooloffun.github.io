        <p>A friend recently asked me if the big brother knows about Santa Claus.</p>

<p>I laughed. Really… :P</p>

<p>Last year, I attempted to introduce the concept of baby Jesus in the nativity scene and the big brother ended up calling any small baby “baby Jesus”. Then, he started going around saying that the baby inside my tummy was baby Jesus. It got worse when he started pointing at any random lady in the street, particularly the horizontally challenged at the tummy, and shouting “Baby Jesus!”… &gt;<em>&lt; *_Quick, hide! She’s looking at us!</em>*</p>

<p>Last month’s attempt to introduce Mary as Jesus’ mommy also didn’t seem to succeed. Although the outcome wasn’t as bad as what happened last year, to the big brother, any picture of a long-haired lady with a long dress was worth shouting “Jesus’ mommy!” for.</p>

<p>Now, try to picture Santa Claus. A big tummy, big white beard and mustache… Having the big brother start to point and shoot “Santa Claus!” at any random man is obviously not in my Christmas wish list this year… :P</p>

<p>Still, we do have to start somewhere, don’t we?! ;)</p>

<p>So, this Christmas, we plan to make our own nativity scene as we slowly introduce him to each character in the nativity scene. We started off with the easiest one of all: the stable… :) I’m pretty sure introducing this concept of “baby Jesus’ house” would cause no harm … :P</p>

<p><strong>What we had</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Paint (we used brown, acrylic)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>water (to dilute the paint)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>white paper</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>plastic bag</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>tissue box</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Let the Fun Begin!</strong></p>

<p>First, I wrapped the old tissue box with few pieces of white paper and cut an opening hole in front.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">The box</p>
    
</div>

<p>Ignore the truck… obviously, the big brother thought I was about to make a garage for his truck…:P</p>

<p>Looking at how wide the surface that the big brother would have to paint, I know there is a high chance that he would run away before completing the stable. So, I decided to let him experiment painting using a plastic bag instead. Faster and of course, more fun! :)</p>

<p>And, that’s it. The stable is ready… ;)</p>
