<p>The little brother just wouldn’t listen when I asked him if he could just stay a baby forever. Even if I’d been pleading for the last 365 days.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this 366th day spells celebration.</p>

<p>Big C-E-L-E-B-R-A-T-I-O-N.</p>

<p>Don’t listen when people tell you that the novelty of first birthday celebration wears off the moment you have your second kid. You, uhm… okie, I mean, we, may not have the energy to throw a big party, but still, it’s a miracle that our second one make it to his first birthday without a scratch. Without us making friends with the ambulance drivers. Or the people at the emergency call center.</p>

<p>See those tiny objects scattered on the floor? Potential choking hazards. Tsk… tsk… tsk… Oh wait, the big brother call them lego, his favorite. The little brother sometimes, though not so often, affectionately call them tasty snack.</p>

<p>And how about those sharp corners? Sure… we may be a tad too late for the baby-proofing stuff, but we’ll get into that child-proofing hopefully soon. Wait, which sharp corners? That one hiding behind the big blocks that the big brother just built? That one behind the big brother’s bicycle? WHAT sharp corners? I see none!</p>

<p>When you’re done counting those sharp corners and unprotected electrical outlet, you might want to shift a little and give way to our beloved dinosaur AKA the big brother. I believe he’s up to stomp just right outside the room to wake his little brother. Or maybe give lesson on wrestling. Or bouncing. Or riding. Or bouncing while riding his little brother… &gt;_&lt;</p>

<p>It’s a miracle that our little one escaped those crawling months unscathed.</p>

<p>And a miracle, my friends, are worth celebrating.</p>

<p>Now, if you could just excuse us, the dinosaur that was stomping right outside the door just now is about to sing, maybe roar…(really!), the happy birthday song (again)… :) He’s been counting down the days to his brother’s birthday for ages!!</p>
