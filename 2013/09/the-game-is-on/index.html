<p>Gone are the days when the big brother and I share the same roof (and all that is under that very same roof!) for nearly 24 x 7. For 4 hours a day, he gets to play with his friends in school and bring home tons of stories for me, as well as … uhm, hello.. germs… welcome back! Didn’t we just see you last week?! &gt;_&lt;”</p>

<p>Gone are the days when thinking out of the box equates to scribbling all over.</p>

<p>Oh yeah… it’s amazing how my once defiant boy has slowly mastered how to sit still, listen and .. well, conform. Peer pressure? Perhaps…</p>

<p>And speaking about peer pressure, another change that we notice is how much the big brother now loves to play games and compete. The more competitive, the better. Hardly a day goes by without a game of musical chair or hide and seek. Yup, we play hide and seek daily at home, even though it feels like playing with a big dinosaur that does a hysterical giggling fit as soon as I finish saying “Ready or not, here I come…”</p>

<p>He also loves board games, such as Twister or snakes and ladders. Simplified version, of course. Our snakes and ladders, for example, only has 25 squares. Good enough before he loses his interest to finish the game… :P</p>

<p>Indeed, there is hardly any day without the words “I win!”. How he loves to win! Geee… who doesn’t?!</p>

<p>To lose, and I mean to lose gracefully, is a skill he has yet to master. Okay, to be fair to him, he’s been trying hard… :) And this game of learning to lose surely takes time and repetition.</p>

<p>For days when he will potentially get upset at losing (you know how there are days when we just feel like we get up on the wrong side of bed!), we try to find games that require cooperation instead. A tad of competition is fine, but not too much.</p>

<p>Few months ago, we created our own simple game.</p>

<p><strong>What we had</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Drawing paper</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Marker</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Crayons</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Die</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bottle caps or bread tags (as many as you can find, say, 40 to 50)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Old cardboard box</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Small colorful figurines (for the tokens)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Let the Fun Begin!</strong></p>

<p>We started off by drawing 20 colorful circles, lining like a snake from one end to another. For each circle, we randomly chose a color from the six colors in our die. If you can’t find similar die, I’m sure you can make your own by coloring a blank cardboard box. Or why not stick some colorful dot stickers on regular 6-sided die? :)</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Coloring the Circles</p>
    
</div>

<p>Next, we made a cardboard “coin” bank by simply cutting a slot big enough to fit the bottle caps on the old cardboard box. Then, we placed all the bottle caps around the circles.</p>

<p><strong>How to play</strong></p>

<p>The idea is to get all the bottle caps into the box before our token reach the last circle. So, first, we place our token in the first circle.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">Keep counting...</p>
    
</div>

<p>Each player gets to roll a die and bring his token to the nearest circle with the color shown on the die. He will need to count the number of circles he travels. For each circle traveled, he gets to put one bottle cap into the box.</p>

    <p class="image-caption">and counting!</p>
    
</div>

<p>Once all the bottle caps are collected in the box, everybody wins… :) Working together is that fun! Easy peasy, and definitely no teary eyes… :P</p>

<p>When we’re not playing, we keep the bottle caps inside the cardboard box. Sometimes, however, the little brother would come and empty the box only to slot all the bottle caps back into the box.</p>
