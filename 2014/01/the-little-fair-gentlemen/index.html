<p>One moment, he might be helping his little brother unravel the mystery of how to properly wear socks, patiently explaining each step. Yup, just like a grown-up. Yet, in another, he claimed that lining his cars in the fridge was the coolest thing to do (<em>Look at the cars’ windows, Mommy!</em>). Yeah, our fridge, his carpark… &gt;_&lt;</p>

<p>There are days when you see a fine young gentleman, polite and all. This little fair gentleman held the door open for an old woman. Even when he was not asked to. Yet, in a split second, he was back running and screaming like a silly, uhm, …. 5-year-old boy.</p>

<p>And yes, there are days when you get to hear “please”, “sorry” and “thank you” more often than “It’s not fair!” or “Noooo!!!”. Or “But I want that… “ Other days seem to need more hard work, though…</p>

<p>I must say that those good days owe much to those days of reading these books. Funny how they all include dinosaurs … :P</p>

<p>There are quite a number in this series. We read these board books much when the big brother was smaller and very much into dinosaurs. He got to enjoy seeing different kids of dinosaurs, while I got to see that he learns “the right thing”. Ha! :D</p>

<p>This book recently went home from the library with us after the little brother chanced upon it. I guess it’s just hard to resist checking out the book when you see such nice illustration! A good book to learn how to read as well as to make friends … :)</p>

<p>We borrowed and read this book countless time! The first time we read it, the 3-year-old big brother thought he was cool when he could guess what the dinosaur or the girl would say each time. He thought he could read! We laughed a lot whenever we read this although I always feel like skipping the part when the dinosaur refused a snack as she was worried about her weight… ^_^” Not that easy to explain to kids, eh?!</p>

<p>I wish you luck in finding these books in the library. We may still be hogging them… <em>_grinz_</em></p>
