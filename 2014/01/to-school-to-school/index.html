<p>Yup, to school, to the big brother’s school, we go! ;)</p>

<p>The school needed a volunteer to conduct a Chinese New Year related art and craft session and we put our hand up. We searched high and low for the perfect activity and thanks to Google, we found just <a href="http://artchoo.com/chinese-new-year-activities/">the right one</a>… :)</p>

<p>Of course, it wouldn’t be fun without a storytelling session. We thought of sharing the ancient folk story about the 12 animals in Chinese zodiac cycle. But really, there is nothing horsey about it. The rat steals the limelight… :P</p>

<p>We need a book with a horse in this Year of the Horse. A mighty horse would be great. A magic horse? Even better! And this Chinese New Year, I couldn’t think of any other book with that to offer than The Magic Horse of Han Gan.<br />

<p>Five years and 2 kids later, I think my storytelling skill has much improved… <em>_yayy!!_</em> Nobody dozed off, even when it was as early as 8 AM. There I was, mesmerized by the beauty of this wide eyed wonder as these kids, my adorable audience, sat down and listened about how Han Gan painted the most powerful horse. Twice!</p>

<p>Next, the kids were introduced to their “magic wands” to make their own magic horses: paint brushes, cotton buds, skewers, toothpicks and … their fingers, of course!</p>

<p>Each kid chose her favorite magic wand and got busy right away. Many of them chose to do finger painting, but some did get creative with the back of their brushes and toothpicks.</p>

<p>If you really want to spot the big brother’s, it’s on the last row, second from left. He said he wanted a cute horse, not a mighty one, so he drew a small one… ^_^”</p>

<p>Later that day, on the way home, the big brother asked if I would come and join him at school again next time. It really made my heart swell with joy. I know he enjoyed taking the assistant role while I conducted the first session (he only got to paint his horse on the second session). But when he asked me that question, I learned that he was proud to have me in his classroom. And the next day, when one of his friends asked the same question, I know I must have done something right somewhere… :’)</p>
