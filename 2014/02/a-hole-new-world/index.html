        <p>I got a lot of spare tires… &gt;_&lt;</p>

<p>Eeeks.. don’t you dare poking my waist. Nope, I’m not referring that around my waist!</p>

<p>I mean, these small tires…</p>

<p>Remember when I told you about <a href="http://theschooloffun.com/2013/11/07/patience-training-in-progress/">how much my little ones love holes</a>? The little brother obviously also adores the tire’s hole. I know I should have shown more gratitude that the little brother’s concentration, hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills are progressing well. Imagine all the muscles he uses to take off those tires from the big brother’s cars! But still, it gets on my nerves, when I’m the one summoned to find and collect all these tires… &gt;_&lt;”</p>

<p>Anyway, the recently acquired books only confirm their not-so-secret love affair.</p>

<p><strong>What’s Wrong with My Hair by Satoshi Kitamura</strong></p>

<p>We first borrowed this when nursing was still the little brother’s favorite pastime. We needed something to entertain the big brother. But, let’s just be frank, sometimes you just don’t want to read the same thing for the <em>n</em>-th time in the day. This book really came in handy then. The big brother could put himself in Lionel’s shoes as the lion tried out different hairstyles. All he had to do is put his face on the head-sized hole, find a mirror, and giggle - repeat as needed… :)</p>

<p>The fact that there are more than one copy of this book in the library only confirms how well-loved this book is. Both my husband and I borrowed this book, separately, around the same time, so, for a while, we ended up having 2 copies at home… :P As the little bird happily pecked, the little brother happily poked his finger through the finger-sized holes. The big brother, on the other hand, took it as a chance to play I Spy: I would read what the bird pecks and he would race me to find the object. Told you…It was great having 2 copies for 2 kids, after all… :P</p>
