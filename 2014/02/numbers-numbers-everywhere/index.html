        <p>Have you ever thought why, as a child, we all love to count and yet, not all of us grow up to love math?</p>

<p>I do not know whether both my kids will later find math frustrating or interesting. I guess first, some sets of milestones have to be reached (Just because a child can count, it doesn’t mean he knows math.). All I can tell is that, just like any other kids, my kids like counting. The big brother beamed when he first figured out how to count from 1 to 10. The little one, well… he skips “One!” and stops at “Two!” for now. That spark of interest… is good enough for me. I don’t expect them to be a mathematician when they grow up.</p>

<p>While personal interest may seem like a good explanation (just like why some prefer dancing to singing, painting to sports, etc.), I do believe that having a good learning companion does matter. I consider myself lucky that I grow up with two big brothers who mysteriously make math fun and interesting. Looking back, I’m pretty amazed at how they could show me how math connects to many interesting things (yeah, I’m still wondering why none of them end up being a teacher!). Math genius? I have no clue - I never check their test scores…hee hee… <em>_seriously, I didn’t bother back then!_</em> But I’m pretty sure they’re both well-read… :)</p>

<p>Anyway… back to counting (We’ll do math next time… :P). If you are into counting, here are some of the good learning companions we’ve found, mostly in the library .. :)</p>

<p><em>“Chicka Chicka 1, 2, 3, will there be a place for me?”</em></p>

<p>It’s a simple story. Really. Numbers climbing up the apple tree, numbers falling down the tree.Yet, you’ll get to go from 1 to 100! We love spotting the big, colorful numbers and of course, <em>_spoiler alert!!!_</em>…. Zero the hero! ;)</p>

<p><strong>Fish Eyes: A Book You Can Count On by Lois Ehlert</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1347357543l/846132.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Something to touch, something to count. This book was great back when the big brother’s attention span was very, very short. His attention span wavered not long after he started if I just asked him to count out loud. But, once I asked him to touch the fish eyes while counting, he marched on! :D</p>

<p>The big brother LOVES this book very much. What to say, it has cars, trucks, different kinds of cars… and different kinds of trucks (Ha! See the pattern?).</p>

<p>We can’t resist any book with an I-Spy potential. Think of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where%27s_Wally%3F">Where’s Wally</a> series, but with numbers. Spot all the number from 1 to 100 spread all over the pages while you go on an airplane ride with Henry and his family… :) Try <strong>Everything Goes: On Land by Brian Biggs</strong> if you’re more into city theme.</p>

<p>If not for my sweet cousin, we wouldn’t get to know about this book and the next book. Yup, we are the proud owners of this very cute book. I almost didn’t let the big brother touch this book. The illustrations are just so nice that it’ll definitely break my heart if I see any of the pages torn! It turns out that the big brother takes good care of it. Observe each character and you’ll laugh at their funny expressions (eeks.. one of them farted!) and captions (and it just said “I feel much better now”!!). There would also be some specific tasks in each page, like finding the mouse with red ribbon. And oh, see if you can spot the animal that came before and the one that follows! Loads of fun!</p>

<p>Again, this is where you’ll get to count from 1 to 100 more than once… :P Five times, in fact! All with different animals. Afraid that you’ll lose count? Don’t worry, you’ll find some of them with numbers so you don’t need to start again from the very beginning. But if you insist, why not… I know they’re just <em>kawaii</em>! And don’t forget to spot the ant, snail and ladybug in each page… ;)</p>

<p>Do share some of your favorite books, too! :)</p>
