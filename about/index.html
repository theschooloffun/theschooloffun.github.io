        <p>Isn’t it ironic that when we send our kids to a child care or a school, we demand so much from it? It has to have the right number of teachers and teach our kids enough to get them ready to be the next candidate for presidency without giving them too much pressure. And those are probably just two among the long list of things that our kids’ school has to promise us, let alone actually provide to our kids.</p>

<p>Yet, when we have our kids at home with us, we simply just turn on the TV and let their eyes be glued to the screen. Educational, you think, but what ever happen to a great time together with our kids?</p>

<p>Now is a good time to take the remote  control away (or perhaps, hide) and have some fun with our kids. Get our kids’ hands dirty and forget about those ugly stains on their clothes. Make way for creativity, never mind the mess it creates. Even cleaning up could make a great avenue to have fun together.</p>

<p>Don’t worry about which activity is good for which development. Even the most trivial activity could benefit our kids and ourselves. Parenting doesn’t always have to be about guilt and doubt. It is an experience like no other.</p>

<p>School of Fun is written by Nicole, a mother of a kindergartner who dreads the concept of sitting still and a toddler who is slowly picking up that very same skill from his big brother. She is temporarily trading days in the office for days at home with her sons and all their quirks and twists. Together with her sons, she enjoys having fun with scissors, glue sticks and paints. She loves her sons’ excitement as they make something out of nothing. She believes that it is the best way to exercise her sons’ little gray cells and little fingers. She also believes that as she keeps them busy, she is actually spared from any possible tantrums that would drive her crazy. And yes, she LOVES crafting!</p>
